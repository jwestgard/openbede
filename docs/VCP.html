    <p>LIFE OF s'r. curanna'r. 211mind. For, as Trumwine of blessed memory told meon the authority of Cuthbert himself, there were oneday some customary games going on in a ﬁeld, and alarge number of boys were got together, amongst whomwas Cuthbert, and in the excitement of boyish whims,several of them began to bend their bodies into variousunnatural forms. On a sudden, one of them, apparentlyabout three years old, runs up to Cuthbert, and in aﬁrm tone exhorts him not to indulge in idle play andfollies, but to cultivate the powers of his mind, as wellas those of his body. When Cuthbert made light ofhis advice, the boy fell to the ground, and shed tearsbitterly. The rest run up to console him, but he persists in weeping. They ask him why he burst out crying so unexpectedly. At length he made answer, andturning to Cuthbert, who was trying to comfort him,“Why,” said he, “ do you, holy Cuthbert, priest andprelate! give yourself up to these things which are soopposite to your nature and rank? It does not becomeyou to be playing among children, when the Lord hasappointed you to be a teacher of virtue even to thosewho are older than yourself.” Cuthbert, being a boyof a good disposition, heard these words with evidentattention, and pacifying the crying child with aﬁ'ectionate caresses, immediately abandoned his vain sports,and retuming home, began from that moment to exhibit an unusual decision both of mind and character,as if the same Spirit Which had spoken outwardly tohim by the mouth of the boy, were now beginning toexert its inﬂuence inwardly in his heart. Nor oughtwe to be surprised that the same God can restrain thelevity of a child by the mouth of a child, who madeeven the dumb beast to speak when He would checkthe folly of the prophet: and truly it is said in hishonour, “ Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hastthou perfected praise.

Oneday he had been carried out of doors by the attendants,and was reclining in the open air, when he suddenlysaw at a distance a man on horseback approaching,clothed in white garments, and honourable to be lookedupon, and the horse, too, on which he sat, was of incomparable beauty. He drew near to Cuthbert, andsaluted him mildly, and asked him as in jest, whetherhe had no civilities to show to such a guest. “ Yes,”said the other, “I should be most ready to jump upand offer you all the attention in my power, were I not,for my sins, held bound by this inﬁrmity: for I havelong had this painful swelling in my knee, and no physician, with all his care, has yet been able to heal me.”The man, leaping from his horse, began to look earnestly at the diseased knee. Presently he said, “ Boilsome Wheaten ﬂour in milk, and apply the poulticeWarm to the swelling, and you will be well.” Havingsaid this, he again mounted his horse and departed.Cuthbert did as he was told, and after a few days was</p>

If any one think it incrediblethat an angel should appear on horseback, let him readthe history of the Maccabees, in which angels are saidto have come on horseback to the assistance of JudasMaccabæus, and to defend God’s own temple.CHAP.

There is, moreover, a monastery lying towards the south, not far fromthe mouth of the river Tyne, at that time consisting ofmonks, but now changed, like all other human things,by time, and inhabited by a noble company of virgins,dedicated to Christ. Now, as these pious servants ofGod were gone to bring from. a distance in ships, upthe above-named river, some timber for the use of themonastery, and had already come opposite the placewhere they were to bring the ships to land, behold aviolent wind, rising from the west, carried away theirships, and scattered them to a distance from the river’smouth. The brethren; seeing this from the monastery,launched some boats into the river, and tried to succourthose who were on board the vessels, but were unable,because the force of the tide and violence of the windsovercame them.

But the Divine will was in nohaste to grant these vows, however earnest; and thiswas, without a doubt, in order that it might be seenwhat eﬂ'ect was in Cuthbert’s prayers. For there wasa large multitude of people standing on the other bankof the river, and Cuthbert also was among them.Whilst the monks were looking on in sorrow, seeingthe vessels, ﬁve in number, hurried rapidly out to sea,so that they looked like ﬁve searbirds on the waves,the multitude began to deride their manner of life, as ifthey had deserved to suffer this loss, by abandoning theusual modes of life, and framing for themselves newrules by which to guide their conduct. Cuthbert re—strained the insults of the blasphemers, saying, “ Whatare you doing, my brethren, in thus reviling thosewhom you see hurried to destrliction? Would it notbe better and more humane to entreat the Lord in theirbehalf, than thus to take delight in their misfortunes ?”But the rustics, turning on him with angry minds andangry mouths, exclaimed, “ Nobody shall pray for them :may God spare none of them! for they have takenaway from men the ancient rites and customs, and howthe new ones are to be attended to, nobody knows.”At this reply, Cuthbert fell on his knees to pray, andbent his head towards the earth; immediately the powerof the winds was checked, the vessels, with their conductors rejoicing, were cast upon the land near themonastery, at the place intended. The rustics blushingfor their inﬁdelity, both on the spot extolled the faithof Cuthbert as it deserved, and never afterwards ceasedto extol it: so that one of the most worthy brothers ofour monastery, from whose mouth I received this narP</p>

One night, whilsthis companions were sleeping, and he himself was awake,as he was wont to be, and engaged in prayer, on a sudden he saw a long stream of light break through thedarkness of the night, and in the midst of it a companyof the heavenly host descended to the earth, and havingreceived among them a spirit of surpassing brightness,returned without delay to their heavenly home. Theyoung man, beloved of God, was struck with the sight,and, stimulated to encounter the honours of spiritualwarfare, and to earn for himself eternal life and happiness among God’s mighty ones, he forthwith oﬁ‘eredup praise and thanksgivings to the Lord, and calledupon his companions, with brotherly exhortatione, toimitate his example. “ Miserable men that we are,”said he, “whilst we are resigning ourselves to sleep andidleness, we take no thought to behold the light ofGod’s holy angels, who never sleep. Behold, whilst Iwas awake and praying, during a moderate portion ofthe night, I saw such great miracles of God.

When the morning wascome, he found that Aidan, bishop of the Church ofLindisfame, a man of exalted piety, had ascended tothe heavenly kingdom at the very moment of his vision.Immediately, therefore, he delivered over the sheep,which he was feeding, to their owners, anddeterminedforthwith to enter a monastery.CHAP.

For on a certainday, as he was journeying alone, he turned aside at thefourth hour into a village which lay at some distance,and to which he found his way. Here he entered thehouse of a pious mother of a family, in order to resthimself a little, and to procure food for his horse ratherthan for himself, for it was the beginning of winter.The woman received him kindly, and begged him toallow her to get him some dinner, that he might refreshhimself.

The woman, froma motive of hospitality, persisted in her request. “ Behold,” said she, “ on the way you are going there is novillage, nor house; you have a long journey before you,and cannot get through it before sunset. Let me en—treat you, therefore, to take some food before you go, orelse you will be obliged to fast all the day, and perhapseven till to-morrow.” But though the woman pressedhim much, his love of religion prevailed, and he fastedthe whole day until the evening.When the evening drew near, and he perceived thathe could not ﬁnish his intended journey the same day,and that there was no house at hand in which he couldpass the night, he presently fell upon some shepherds’huts, which, having been slightly constructed in thesummer, were now deserted and ruinous. Into one ofthese he entered, and having tied his horse to the wall,placed before him a handful of hay, which the wind hadforced from the roof. He then turned his thoughts toprayer, but suddenly, as he was singing a psalm, hesaw his horse lm; up his head and pull out some strawfrom the roof, and among the straw there fell down alinen cloth folded up, with something in it. When hehad ended his prayers, wishing to see what this was,he came and opened the cloth, and found in it half of aloaf of bread, still hot, and some meat, enough of bothto serve him for a single meal. In gratitude for theDivine goodness, he exclaimed, “Thanks be to God,who of his bounty hath deigned to provide a meal for mewhen I was hungry, as well as a supper for my beast.”He therefore divided the piece of bread into two parts,of which he gave one to his horse and kept the otherfor himself; and from that day forward he was moreready than before to fast, because he now felt convinced</p>

I learnt theseparticulars from a religious man of our monastery ofWeremouth, a priest of the name of Ingwald, who now,by reason of his extreme old age, is turning his attention, in purity of heart, to spiritual things rather thanto earthly and carnal affections, and who said that theauthority on which his relation rested was no less thanthat of Cuthbert himself.CHAP.

Boisil,without saying more, kindly received Cuthbert as heapproached; and when he had heard the cause of hiscoming, namely, that he preferred the monastery to theworld, he kept him near himself, for he was the prior ofthat same monastery.After a few days, when Eata, who was at that timepriest and abbot of the monastery, but afterwardsbishop of Lindisfame, was come, Boisil told him aboutCuthbert, how that he was a young man of a promisingdisposition, and obtained permission that he should receive the tonsure, and be enrolled among the brethren.When he had thus entered the monastery, he conformed himself to the rules of the place with the samezeal as the others, and, indeed, sought to surpass themby observing stricter discipline; and in reading, working, watching, and praying, he fairly outdid them all.Like the mighty Samson of old, be carefully abstainedfrom every drink which could intoxicate; but was notable to abstain equally from food, lest his body mightbe thereby rendered less able to work: for he was ofa robust frame and of unimpaired strength, and ﬁtfor any labour which he might be disposed to take inhand.</p>

The abbot, in consequence. » *? f"; of this grant, erected the intendedbuilding, and placed therein certain of his brother—monks, among whom was Cuthbert,and appointed for them the same rules and disciplinewhich were observed at Melrose. It chanced that Cuthbert was appointed to the ofﬁce of receiving strangers,and he is said to have entertained an angel of the Lordwho came to make trial of his piety. For, as he wentvery early in the morning, from the interior of themonastery into the strangers’ cell, he found there seateda young person, whom he considered to be a man, andentertained as such. He gave him water to wash hishands; he washed his feet himself, wiped them, andhumbly dried them in his bosom; after which he en—treated him to remain till the third hour of the day andtake some breakfast, lest, if he should go on his journeyfasting, he might suffer from hunger and the cold ofwinter. For he took him to be a man, and thoughtthat a long journey by night and a severe fall of snowhad caused him to tum in thither in the morning torest himself. The other replied, that he could not tarry,for the home to which he was hastening lay at somedistance. After much entreaty, Cuthbert adjured himin God’s name to stop; and as the third hour was nowcome, prayer over, and it was time to breakfast, heplaced before him a table with some food, and said, “ I</p>

The man of God was astonished, and revolvingthe circumstance in his mind, put back the table in thedining-room. Whilst doing so, he perceived a mostsurprising odour and sweetness; and looking round tosee from what it might proceed, he saw three whiteloaves placed there, of unusual whiteness and excellence. Trembling at the sight, he said within himself,“I perceive that it was an angel of the Lord whom Ientertained, and that he came to feed us, not to be fedhimself. Behold, he hath brought such loaves as thisearth never produced; they surpass the lily in whiteness, the rose in odour, and honey in taste. They are,therefore, not produced from this earth, but are sentfrom paradise. No wonder that he rejected my offerof earthly food, when he enjoys such bread as this inheaven.” The man of God was stimulated by thispowerful miracle to be more zealous still in performingworks of piety; and with his deeds did increase uponhim also the gljace of God. From that time he oftensaw and conversed with angels, and when hungry wasfed with unwonted food furnished direct from God.

But our worthy champion of Christ did not by reason of his change of placerelax his zeal in carrying on the spiritual conﬂict whichhe had undertaken; but he attended, as he had everdone, to the precepts and example of the blessed Boisil.About this time, according to his friend Herefrid thepriest, who was formerly abbot of the monastery of Lin—disfarne, he was seized with a pestilential disease, ofwhich many inhabitants of Britain were at that timesick. The brethren of the monastery passed the wholenight in prayer for his life and health; for they thoughtit essential to them that so pious &amp; man should be present with them in the ﬂesh. They did this without hisknowing it ; and when they told him of it in the morning, he exclaimed, “ Then why am I lying here? I didnot think it possible that God should have neglectedyour prayers: give me my stick and shoes.” Accordingly, he got out of bed, and tried to walk, leaning onhis stick; and ﬁnding his strength gradually return, heWas speedily restored to health: but because the swelling on his thigh, though it died away to all outwardappearances, struck into his inwards, he felt a littlepain in his inside all his life afterwards; so that, as weQ</p>

I advise you, inasmuch asdeath is waiting for me, to learn from me all you canwhilst I am able to teach you; for I have only sevendays longer to enjoy my health of body, or to exercisethe powers of my tongue.” Cuthbert, implicitly believing what he heard, asked him what he would advisehim to begin to read, so as to be able to ﬁnish it inseven days. “ John the Evangelist,” said Boisil. “ Ihave a copy containing seven quarto sheets: we can,with God’s help, read one every day, and meditatethereon as far as we are able.” They did so accordingly, and speedily accomplished the task; for theysought therein only that simple faith which operates bylove, and did not trouble themselVes with minute andsubtle questions. After their seven days’ study wascompleted, Boisil died of the above-named complaint;and after death entered into the joys of eternal life.They say that, during these seven days, he foretold toCuthbert every thing which should happen to him: for,as I have said before, he was a prophet and a man ofremarkable piety. And, moreover, he had three yearsago foretold to Abbot Esta, that this pestilence wouldcome, and that he himself would die of it; but that theabhot should die of another disease, which the physicians call dysentery; and in this also he was a trueprophet, as the event proved. Among others, he toldCuthbert that he should be ordained bishop. WhenCuthbert became an anchorite, he would not communicate this prophecy to any one, but with much sorrowQ2</p>

Tocorrect these errors, he oﬁen went out from the monastery, sometimes on horseback, sometimes on foot, andpreached the way of truth to the neighbouring villages,as Boisil, his predecessor, had done before him. It wasat this time customary for the English people to ﬂocktogether when a clerk or priest entered a village, andlisten to what he said, that so they might leam something from him, and amend their lives.

Now one night, a brother of the monastery,seeing him go out alone, followed him privately to seewhat he should do. But be, when he left the monastery, went down to the sea, which ﬂows beneath, andgoing into it, until the water reached his neck andarms, spent the night in praising God. When thedawn of day approached, he came out of the water,and, falling on his knees, began to pray again. Whilsthe was doing this, two quadrupeds, called otters, cameup from the sea, and, lying down before him on thesand, breathed upon his feet, and wiped them with theirhair: after which, having received his blessing, theyreturned to their native element. Cuthbert himselfreturned home in time to join in the accustomed hymnswith the other brethren. The brother, who waited forhim on the heights, was so terriﬁed that he could hardlyreach home ; and early in the morning he came and fellat his feet, asking his pardon, for he did not doubt thatCuthbert was fully acquainted with all that had takenplace. To whom Cuthbert replied, “ What is the matter, my brother? What have you done? Did youfollow me to see what I was about to do? I forgiveyou for it on one condition,—-that you tell it to nobodybefore my death.” In this he followed the example ofour Lord, who, when He showed his glory to his disciples 0n the mountain, said, “See that you tell noman, until the Son of man be risen from the dead.”When the brother had assented to this condition, hegave him his blessing, and released him from all histrouble.

Once upon a time he left the monasteryfor some necessary reason, and went by sea to the landof the Picts, which is called Niduari. Two of thebrethren accompanied him; and one of these, who afterwards discharged the priest’s ofﬁce, made known toseveral the miracle which the man of God there performed. They arrived there the day after Christmasday, hoping, because the weather and sea were bothtranquil, that they should soon return; and for thisreason they took no food with them. They were, however, deceived in their expectations; lfor no sooner werethey come to land, than a tempest arose, and preventedthem from returning. After stopping there severaldays, suffering from cold and hunger, the day of theholy Epiphany was at hand, and the man of God, whohad spent the night in prayer and watching, not inidleness or sloth, addressed them with cheerful andsoothing language, as he was accustomed: “Why dowe remain here idle?

I pray you, therefore, to come with me and see what provision He hasmade for us, that we may ourselves rejoice in his joy.”Saying these words, he led them to the shore wherehe himself had been accustomed to pray at night. Ontheir arrival, they found there three pieces of dolphin’sﬂesh, looking as if some one had cut them and preparedthem to be cooked. They fell on their knees and gavethanks to God. “ You see, my beloved brethren,” saidCuthbert, “how great is the grace of God to him whohopes and trusts in the Lord. Behold, He has preparedfood for his servants; and by the number three pointsout to us how long we must remain here. Take, therefore, the gifts which Christ has sent us; let us go andrefresh ourselves, and abide here without fear, for afterthree days there will most assuredly be a calm, both ofthe heavens and of the sea.” All this was so as he hadsaid: three days the storm lasted most violently; onthe fourth day the promised calm followed, and theyreturned with a fair wind home.CHAP.

It ispossible for God to feed us even by means of thateagle.” As they were thus discoursing, they came neara river, and behold the eagle was standing on its bank.“ Look,” said the man of God, “ there is our handmaid,the eagle, that I spoke to you about. Run, and seewhat provision God hath sent us, and come again andtell me.” The boy ran, and found a good—sized ﬁsh,which the eagle had just caught. But the man of Godreproved him, “ What have you done, my son? Whyhave you not given part to God’s handmaid? Cut theﬁsh in two pieces, and give her one, as her service welldeserves.” He did as he was hidden, and carried theother part with him on his journey. When the timefor eating was come, they turned aside to a certainvillage, and having given the ﬁsh to be cooked, madean excellent repast, and gave also to their entertainers,whilst Cuthbert preached to them the word of God,and blessed Him for his mercies ; for happy is the manwhose hope is in the name of the Lord, and who hasnot looked upon vanity and foolish deceit.

Nearly thewhole multitude rushed forward, to extinguish the ﬁre,(for he restrained a few of them himself,) but yet withall their real water they could not put out the falseﬂames, until, at Cuthbert’s prayer, the author of thedeceit was put to ﬂight, and his ﬁctitious ﬁres dispersedalong with him. The multitude, seeing this, were suffused with' ingenuous blushes, and, falling on theirknees before him, prayed to be forgiven for their ﬁckle.ness of mind, acknowledging their conviction that thedevil never rests even for an hour from impeding thework of man’s salvation. But he, encouraging themunder their inﬁrmity, again began to preach to themthe words of everlasting life.</p>

For, as hewas travelling about, preaching salvation, like the apostles of old, he one day entered thehouse of a pious woman, whom he was in the habit ofoften visiting, and whom, from having been nursed byher in his infancy, he was accustomed on that accountto call his mother. The house was at the west end ofthe village, and Cuthbert had no sooner entered it topreach the word of God, than a house at the other endof the place caught ﬁre and began to blaze most dreadfully. For the wind was from the same quarter, so thatthe sparks from the kindled thatch ﬂew over the wholeVillage. Those who were present tried to extinguish itwith water, but were driven back by the heat. Thenthe aforesaid handmaid of the Lord, running to thehouse where Cuthbert was, hesought him to help them,before her own house and the others in the villageshould be destroyed. “ Do not fear, mother,” said he;“be of good cheer; this devouring ﬂame will not hurteither you or yours.” He then went out and threwhimself prostrate on the grdund before the door. Whilsthe was praying, the wind changed, and beginning toblow from the west, removed all danger of the ﬁreassailing the house, into which the man of God hadentered.And thus in two miracles he imitated the virtues ofR2</p>

For in the case of the apparitionof ﬁre above mentioned, he imitated the reverend andholy father Saint Benedict, who by his prayers droveaway the apparition of a ﬁre like a burning kitchen,which the old enemy had presented before the eyes ofhis disciples: and, in the case of the real ﬁre which hethus extinguished, he imitated that venerable priestMarcellinus of Ancona, who, when his native town wason ﬁre, placed himself in ﬁ'ont of the ﬂames, and putthem out by his prayers, though all the exertions of hisfellow-countrymen had failed to extinguish them withwater. Nor is it wonderful that such perfect and piousservants of God should receive power against the forceof ﬁre, considering that by their daily piety they enablethemselves to conquer the desires of the ﬂesh, and toextinguish all the ﬁery darts of the wicked one: and tothem is applicable the saying of the prophet, [Is. xliii.2.] “ When thou walkest through the ﬁre, thou shaltnot be burned ; neither shall the ﬁre kindle upon thee.”But I, and those who are, like me, conscious of ourown weakness and inertness, are sure that we can donothing in that way against material ﬁre, and, indeed,are by no means sure that we shall be able to escapeunhurt from that ﬁre of future punishment, whichnever shall be extinguished.

There wasa certain præfect of King ngrid, Hildemer by name,a man devoted with all his house to good works, andtherefore especially beloved by Saint Cuthbert, andoften visited by him whenever he was journeying thatway. This man’s wife, who was devoted to almsgivingand other fruits of virtue, was suddenly so aﬂiicted bya devil, that she gnashed her teeth, uttered the mostpitiable cries, and, throwing about her arms and limbs,caused great terror to all who saw or heard her. Whilstshe was lying in this state, and expected to die, herhusband mounted his horse, and, coming to the man ofGod, besought his help, saying, “ My wife is ill, and atthe point of death: I entreat you to send a priest tovisit her before she dies, and minister to her the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ ; and, also, thatwhen she is dead, she may be buried in this holy place.”He was ashamed to say that she was out of her senses,because the man of God had always seen her in herright mind. Whilst the holy man was going to ﬁndout a priest to send to her, he reﬂected in his mind thatit was no ordinary inﬁrmity, but a visitation of thedevil; and so, returning to the man who had come toentreat him in his wife’s behalf, he said, “I will notsend any one, but I will go myselfto visit her.”Whilst they were going, the man began to cry, andthe tears ran down his cheeks, for he was afraid lestCuthbert, ﬁnding her aﬁlicted with a devil, should thinkthat she had been a false servant of the Lord, and thather faith was not real. The man of God consoled him:“Do not weep because I am likely to ﬁnd your wifeotherwise than I could wish; for I know that she isvexed with a devil, though you are afraid to name it:and I know, moreover, that, before we arrive, she willbe freed, and come to meet us, and will herself take the</p>

The woman, freedfrom her suﬂ'ering, rose up immediately, as if from sleep,and, meeting the man of God with joy, held the bridleof his horse, and, having entirely recovered her strength,both of mind and body, begged him to dismount andto bestow his blessing upon her house ; and ministeringsedulously to him, testiﬁed openly that, at the ﬁrsttouch of the rein, she had felt herself relieved from allthe pain of her former suffering.CHAP.

Wherefore all the principale of that place from him to thepresent time exercise the episcopal ofﬁce; so that, whilstthe monastery is governed by the abbot, whom they,with the consent of the brethren, have elected, all thepriests, deacons, singers, readers, and other ecclesiastical oﬂicers of diﬁ'erent ranks, observe the monastic rulein every respect, as well as the bishop himself. Theblessed Pope Gregory showed that he approved thismode of life, when, in answer to Augustine, his ﬁrstmissionary to Britain, who asked him how bishopsought to converse with their clerks, among other remarks he replied, “ Because, my brother, having beeneducated in the monastic rule, you ought not to keepaloof from your clerks: in the English Church, which,thanks be to God, has lately been converted to thefaith, you should institute the same system, which hasexisted from the ﬁrst beginning of our Church amongour ancestors, none of whom said that the things whichhe possessed were his own, but they had all thingscommon.” When Cuthbert, therefore, came to thechurch or monastery of Lindisfarne, he taught the brethren monastic rules both by his life and doctrines, andoften going round, as was his custom, among the neighbouring people, he kindled them up to seek after andwork out a heavenly reward. Moreover, by his miracleshe became more and more celebrated, and by the eamestness of his prayers restored to their former healthmany that were afﬂicted with various inﬁrmities andsufferings; some that were vexed with unclean spirits,he not only cured whilst present by touching them,praying over them, or even by commanding or exorcising the devils to go out of them; but even whenabsent be restored them by his prayers, or by foretelling that they should be restored; amongst whom alsowas the wife of the præfect above mentioned.</p>

But he got the better of these by his patienceand modest virtues, and by daily practice at lengthbrought them to the better system which he had inview. Moreover, in his discussions with the brethren,when he was fatigued by the bitter taunts of those whoopposed him, he would rise from his seat with a placidlook, and dismiss the meeting until the following day,when, as if he had suffered no repulse, he would use thesame exhortations as before, until he converted them, asI have said before, to his own views. For his patiencewas most exemplary, and in enduring the oppositionwhich was heaped equally upon his mind and body, hewas most resolute, and, amid the asperities which heencountered, he always exhibited such placidity ofcountenance, as made it evident to all that his outwardvexations were compensated for by the internal consolations of the Holy Spirit.But he was so zealous in watching and praying, thathe is believed to have sometimes passed three or fournights together therein, during which time he neitherwent to his own bed, nor had any accommodation fromthe brethren for reposing himself. For be either passedthe time alone, praying in some retired spot, or singingand making something with his hands, thus beguilinghis sleepiness by labour; or, perhaps, he walked roundthe island, diligently examining every thing therein, andby this exercise relieved the tediousness of psalmodyand watching. Lastly, he would reprove the faintheartedness of the brethren, who took it amiss if anyone came and unseasonably importuned them to awakeat night or during their afternoon naps. “ No one,”said he, “ can displease me by waking me out of mysleep, but, on the contrary, give me pleasure; for, byrousing me from inactivity, he enables me to do orthink of something useful."

But whilst he duly discharged themysteries of our Lord’s passion, he would, in himself,illustrate that in which he was oﬂiciating; in contritionof heart he would sacriﬁce himself to the Lord; andwhilst he exhorted the standers-by to lift up theirhearts and to give thanks unto the Lord, his own heartwas lifted up rather than his voice, and it was the spiritwhich groaned within him rather than the note of singing. In his zeal for righteousness he was fervid to correct sinners, he was gentle in the spirit of mildness toforgive the penitent, so that he would oﬁen shed tearsover those who confessed their sins, pitying their weaknesses, and would himself point out by his own righteous example what course the sinner should pursue.He used vestments of the ordinary description, neithernoticeable for their too great neatness, nor yet tooslovenly. Wherefore, even to this day, it is not customary in that monastery for any one to wear vestmentsof a rich or valuable colour, but they are. content withthat appearance which the natural wool of the sheeppresents.By these and such like spiritual exercises, this venerable man both excited the good to follow his example,and recalled the wicked and perverse from their errorsto regularity of life.CHAP.

He rejoiced that from the long conversationwith the world he was now thought worthy to be promoted to retirement and Divine contemplation: he rejoiced that he now ‘could reach to the condition of thoseof whom it is sung by the Psalmist: “ The holy shallwalk from virtue to virtue; the God of Gods shall beseen in Zion.” At his ﬁrst entrance upon the solitarylife, he sought out the most retired spot in the outskirtsof the monastery. But when he had for some timecontended with the invisible adversary with prayer andfasting in this solitude, he then, aiming at higherthings, sought out a more distant ﬁeld for conﬂict, andmore remote from the eyes of men. There is a certainisland called Fame, in the middle of the sea, not madean island, like Lindisfame, by the ﬂow of the tide, whichthe Greeks call rheuma, and then restored to the mainland at ita ebb, but lying off several miles to the East,and, consequently, surrounded on all sides by the deepand boundless ocean. No one, before God’s servantCuthbert, had ever dared to inhabit this island alone,on account of the evil spirits which reside there: butwhen this servant of Christ came, armed with the helmetof salvation, the shield of faith, and the sword of theSpirit, which is the word of God, all the ﬁery darts ofthe wicked were extinguished, and that wicked enemy,with all his followers, were put to ﬂight.Christ’s soldier, therefore, having thus, by the expulsion of the tyrants, become the lawful monarch of theland, built a city ﬁt for his empire, and houses thereinsuitable to his city. The building is almost of a roundform, from wall to wall about four or ﬁve poles inextent: the wall on the outside is higher than a man,but within, by excavating the rock, he made it muchdeeper, to prevent the eyes and the thoughts from wandering, that the mind might be wholly bent on heavenlythings, and the pious inhabitant might behold nothing3</p>

Thewall was constructed, not of hewn stones or of brickand mortar, but of rough stones and turf, which hadbeen taken out from the ground within. Some of themwere so large that four men could hardly have liftedthem, but Cuthbert himself, with angels helping him,had raised them up and placed them on the wall. Therewere two chambers in the house, one an oratory, theother for domestic purposes. He ﬁnished the wallsof them by digging round and cutting away the naturalsoil within and without, and formed the roof out ofrough poles and straw. Moreover, at the landing-placeof the island he built a large house, in which the brethren who visited him might be received and rest themselves, and not far from it there was a fountain of waterfor their use.CHAP.

Atﬁrst, indeed, when the brethren came to visit him, hewould leave his cell and minister to them. He used towash their feet devoutly with warm water, and was'sometimes compelled by them to take off his shoes,that they might wash his feet also. For he had so farwithdrawn his mind from attending to the care of hisperson, and ﬁxed it upon the concerns of his soul, thathe would often spend whole months without taking offhis leathern gaiters. Sometimes, too, he would keephis shoes on from one Easter to another, only takingthem off on account of the washing of feet, which thentakes place at the Lord’s Supper. Wherefore, in consequence of his frequent prayers and genuﬂexions, whichhe made with his shoes on, he was discovered to havecontracted a callosity on the junction of his feet andlegs. At length, as his zeal after perfection grew, heshut himself up in his cell away from the sight of men,and spent his time alone in fasting, watching, andprayer, rarely having communication with any one without, and that through the window, which at first wasleii open, that he might see and be seen; but, after atime, be shut that also, and opened it only to give hisblessing, or for any other purpose of absolute necessity.</p>

He thereforeasked the brethren, who came to visit him, when theyreturned the next time, to bring him a beam twelvefeet long, to support his intended building. They readily promised to bring it, and having received his blessing, departed ; but by the time they reached home theyhad entirely forgotten the matter, and on their nextvisit neglected to carry the timber which they hadpromised. He received them mildly, and giving themwelcome in God’s name, asked them for the wood whichhe had requested them to bring. Then they, remembering what they had promised, apologized for theirforgetfulness.

Yea, they soughtto discourage me by various trials of apparitione, andto exterminate me from this scene of trial, but werenever able to affect my body with injury, or my mindwith fear.”</p>

    <p>He was accustomed to relate these things more frequently to the brotherhood, lest they should wonder athis conversation as being peculiarly exalted, because,despising secular cares, he preferred to live apart.“But,” said he, “ the life of monks may well be wondered at, who are subjected in all things to the ordersof the abbot, the times of watching, praying, fasting,and working, being all regulated according to his will;many of whom have I known far exceed my littleness,both in purity of mind and advancement in propheticgrace. Among whom must I mention, with all honour,the venerable Boisil, servant of Christ, who, when ahold man, formerly supported me in my youth at Melrose Abbey, and while instructing me, he foretold, withprophetic truth, all things which would happen to me;and of all things which he foretold to me, one aloneremains which I hope may never be accomplished.”Cuthbert told us this was a prophecy of Boisil, thatthis, our holy servant of Christ, should attain to theoﬂice of a bishop; though he, in his eagerness after theheavenly life, felt horriﬁed at the announcement.CHAP.

About this time,as she aﬁerwards told the reverend Herefrid, presbyterof the church of Lindisfarne, who related it to me, shewas afﬂicted with a severe illness and suffered long,insomuch that she seemed almost at the gates of death.The physicians could do her no good, when, on a sudden, the Divine grace worked within her, and she bydegrees was saved from death, though not fully cured.The pain in her inside left her, the strength of herlimbs returned, but the power of standing and walkingwas still denied her; for she could not support herselfon her feet, nor move from place to place, save on allfours. Her sorrow was, therefore, great; and she neverexpected to recover from her weakness, for she had longabandoned all hope from the physicians. One day, asshe was indulging her bitter thoughts, she turned hermind to the holy and tranquil life of the reverendfather Cuthbert; and expressed a wish that she hadin her possession some article that had belonged tohim; “ for I know, and am conﬁdent,” said she, “ thatI should soon be well.” N ot long iiber this, there camea person who brought with him a linen girdle fromSaint Cuthbert: she was overjoyed at the gift, andperceiving that Heaven had revealed to the saint herwish, she put it on, and the next morning found herselfable to stand upon her feet. On the third day she wasrestored to perfect health.A few days after, one of the virgins of the samemonastery was taken ill with a violent pain in thehead ; and whilst the complaint became so much worsethat she thought she should die, the venerable abbesswent in to see her. Seeing her sorely aﬂlicted, shebrought the girdle of the man of God to her, and boundit round her head. The same day the pain in the headleft her, and she laid up the girdle in her chest. Theabbess wanted it again a few days after, but it could not'r 2</p>

After a short silence,he said, “ Do not say that he is without heirs, for heshall have a successor, whom you shall embrace likengrid himself with the affection of a sister.”——f‘ But,”said she, “ I beseech you to tell me where he may befound.” He answered, “ You behold this great andspacious sea, how it aboundeth in islands. It is easyfor God out of some of these to provide a person toreign over England.” She therefore understood himto speak of Alfrid, who was said to be the son of herfather, and was then, on account of his love of literature, exiled to the Scottish islands. But she was awarethat ngrid proposed to make him a bishop, and wish</p>

    <p>ing to know if the effect would follow the intention,she began by inquiring in this manner: “ Oh, withwhat various intentions are the hearts of men distracted ! Some rejoice in havihg obtained riches, othersalways eager aﬁer them are still in want: but thourejectest the glory of the world, although it is offeredthee; and although thou mightest obtain a bishopric,than which there is nothing more sublime on earth, yetthou preferrest the recesses of thy desert to this rank.”—“ But,” said he, “ I know that I am not worthy of sohigh a rank; nevertheless, I cannot shun the judgmentof the Supreme Ruler, who, if he decreed that I shouldsubject myself to so great a burden, would, I believe,restore me after a moderate freedom, and perhaps afternot more than two years would send me back to myformer solitude and quiet. But I must ﬁrst requestyou in the name of our Lord and Saviour that you donot relate to any one before my death the things whichI have told you.” When he had expounded to her thevarious things which she asked, and had instructed herconcerning the things which she had need of, he returned to his solitary island and monastery, and continued his mode of life as he had commenced it.. Not long after, in a full synod, Archbishop Theodoreof blessed memory presiding in the presence of God’schosen servant, the holy King ngrid, he was unanimously elected to the bishopric of the see of Lindisfarne. But, although they sent many messengers andletters to him, he could not by any means be drawnfrom his habitation, until the king himself, above mentioned, sailed to the island, attended by the most holyBishop Trumwine, and by as many other religious andinﬂuential men as he could: they all went down ontheir knees before him, and adjured him by the Lord,with tears and entreaties, until they drew him awayfrom his retirement with tears in his eyes, and tookhim to the synod.

    <p>which I agreed. Some time aﬁer this, when we wereindulging ourselves in eating, merriment, and conversation, I again began to admonish them that we shouldbe solicitous in prayer and watchfulness, and ever prepared to meet all temptations. But they replied, ‘ Youteach well; nevertheless, as the days of fasting, watching, and prayer are numerous, let us to—day rejoice inthe Lord. For the angel manifested great joy to theshepherds when the Lord was born, and told them thatit was a day to be celebrated by all people !’ ‘ Well,’said I, ‘let us do so.’ But when I repeated the wordsof the same admonition the third time, they perceivedthat I would not have suggested this so earnestly forno purpose, and said to me in fear, ‘ Let us do as youteach, for it is incumbent on us to watch in spirit,armed against the snares and temptations of the devil.’When I said these things, I did not know any morethan they that any new temptation would happen tous; but I was only admonished, as it were instinctively,that the state of the heart is to be always fortiﬁedagainst the storms of temptations. But when theyreturned from me to their own home, that is, to themonastery of Lindisfarne, they found that one of theirbrethren was dead of a pestilence; and the same disease increased, and raged so furiously from day to day,for months, and almost for a whole year, that thegreater part of that noble assembly of spiritual fathersand brethren were sent into the presence of the Lord.Now, therefore, my brethren, watch and pray, that ifany tribulation assail you, it may ﬁnd you prepared.”When the venerable man of God, Cuthbert, had saidthese things, the brethren thought, as I have beforestated, that he spoke of a return of the pestilence. Butthe day after, a man who had escaped from the warexplained, by the lamentable news which he brought,the hidden prophecies of the man of God.

Nowthere was a venerable priest of the name of Herebert,who had long been united to the man of God, Cuthbert, in the bond of spiritual friendship, and who, leading a solitary life, in an island in the large marsh fromWhich the Derwent rises, used to come to him everyyear, and receive from him admonitions in the way ofeternal life. When this man heard that he was stopping in that city, he came according to his custom,desiring to be kindled up more and more by his wholesome exhortations in aspiring after heavenly things.When these two had drunk deeply of the cup of celestial wisdom, Cuthbert said, among other things, “ Remember, brother Herebert, that you ask me now. concerning whatever undertaking you may have in hand,and that you speak to me about it now, because, afterwe shall have separated, we shall see each other nomore in this life. I am certain that the time of mydeath approaches, and the time of leaving my earthlytenement is at hand.” Upon hearing these words, hethrew himself at his feet With tears and lamentations,saying, “I beseech you by the Lord not to leave me,but be mindful of your companion, and pray the Almighty Goodness that, as we have served Him togetheron earth, we may at the same time pass to heaven to</p>

But Herebert was ﬁrst afﬂictedwith a long inﬁrmity, perhaps by a dispensation of holypiety, in order that the continual pain of a long sicknessmight supply what merit he had less than the blessedCuthbert, so that being by grace made equal to his intercessor, he might be rendered worthy to depart thislife at one and the same hour with him, and to bereceived into one and the same seat of everlasting happiness.CHAP.

He entered the bedroom in which shelay, as if dead, and sprinkled her and ,the bed, andpoured some of the healing draught down her throat.Oh, wonderful and extraordinary circumstance! theholy water had scarcely touched the patient, who waswholly ignorant what was brought her, than she was sorestored to health, both of mind and body, that beingcome to her senses she blessed the Lord and returnedthanks to Him, that He thought her worthy to bevisited and healed by such exalted guests. She got upwithout delay, and being now well, ministered to thosewho had been instrumental in curing her; and it wasextraordinary to see her, who had escaped the bittercup of death by the bishop’s benediction, now the ﬁrstof the nobleman’s family to offer him refreshment, fol—lowing the example of the mother—in-law of the ApostlePeter, who, being cured of a fever by the Lord, aroseforthwith and ministered unto Him and his disciples.CHAP.

They therefore ﬁlled a cup with water,and putting a little of the bread into it, gave it him todrink: the water thus hallowed by the bread no soonertouched his stomach than all his inward pain left him,and the wasting of his outward members ceased. Aperfect recovery speedily ensued, and both himself andthe others who saw or heard the rapidity of this wonderful cure were thereby stirred up to praise the holiness of Christ’s servant, and to admire the virtues ofhis true faith.CHAP.

Hethen betook himself to his usual weapon, prayer, andbestowing his blessing, expelled the fever, which allthe care and medicines of the physicians had not beenable to cure. In short, he rose up the same hour, andhaving refreshed himself with food, and given thanks toGod, walked back to the women who had brought him.And so it came to pass, that whereas they‘had in sorrow brought the sick man thither, he now returnedhome with them, safe and well, and all rejoicing, bothhe and they alike.:CHAP.

But being arrived at acertain village, and having there exhorted all whom hefound there, he said to his attendant priest, “ Do youthink that any one remains who has need that we shouldvisit and converse with him? or have we now seen allhere, and shall we go elsewhere ?"

XXXV.—How HE CHANGED WATER BYTASTING IT, so THAT IT HAD THE FLAvoun OFWINE.WHEN he had gone regularly through the upperdistricts, he came to a nunnery, which we have beforementioned, not far from the mouth of the river Tyne ;where he was magniﬁcently entertained by Christ’sservant, Abbess Verca,—a woman of a most noble character, both in spiritual and temporal concerns. Whenthey rose from their afternoon repose, he said he wasthirsty, and asked for drink. They inquired of himwhat he would have, whether they should bring himwine, or beer. “Give me water,” said he; and theybrought him a draught from the fountain. But he,when he had given thanks and tasted it, gave it to hisattendant priest, who returned it to the servant. Theman, taking the cup, asked if he might drink out ofthe same cup as the bishop. “ Certainly,” said thepriest, “why not P” Now that priest also belonged tothe same monastery. He therefore drank, and the* water seemed to him to taste like wine. Upon whichhe gave the cup to the brother who was standing near,that he might be a witness of so great a miracle ; andto him also the taste seemed, without a doubt, to bethat of wine. They looked at one another in amaze</p>

XXXVI.—How SOME op THE BRETHREN,non DISOBEDIENCE T0 HIM, WERE DETAINED BYA STORM AT SEA.WHEN Cuthbert had passed two years in the episcopal ofﬁce, knowing in spirit that his last day was athand, he divested himself of his episcopal duties andreturned to his much-loved solitude, that he mightthere occupy his time in extracting the thorns of theﬂesh, and kindle up to greater brightness the ﬂame ofhis former humility. At this time he was accustomedto go out frequently from his cell, and converse withthe brethren, who came to visit him. I will here mention a miracle which he then wrought, in order that itmay be more evident to all men what obedience shouldbe rendered to his saints, even in the case of commandswhich they seem to have given with carelessness orindifference. He had one day left his cell, to giveadvice to some visitors; and when he had ﬁnished, hesaid to them, “ I must now go in again; but do you, asyou are inclined to depart, ﬁrst take food; and whenyou have cooked and eaten that goose, which is hangingon the wall, go on board your vessel in'God’s name,and return home.” He then uttered a prayer, and,having blessed them, went in. But they, as he hadhidden them, took some food ; but having enough provisions of their own, which they had brought with them,they did not touch the goose.N ow when they had refreshed themselves, they tried</p>

Ingressus autem domum, in qua manebant, ut vidit aucamnon fuisse comestum, placido vultu et" læto potius sermone redarguit eorum inobedientiam, ‘ Nonne,’ inquiens,‘incomesta adhuc pendet auca? et quid mirum si vosmare non sivit abire? Citissime ergo mittite eam incaldariam; coquite et comedite, ut possit mare quiescere, et vos domum remittere.’Fecerunt statim ut jusserat, contigitque miro ordine,ut cum ad præceptum viri Dei coctura in caldaria, focoagente, fervere cæpisset, eadem hora unda in mari, cessantibus ventis, suo a fervore quiesceret.

    <p>to go on board their vessel, but a sudden storm utterlyprevented them from putting to sea. They were thusdetained seven days in the island by the roughness ofthe waves, and yet they could not call to mind whatfault they had committed. They therefore returned tohave an interview with the holy father, and to lamentto him their detention. He exhorted them to be patient, and on the seventh day came out to console theirsorrow, and give them pious exhortations. When, however, he had entered the house in which they werestopping, and saw that the goose was not eaten, hereproved their disobedience with mild countenance andin gentle language. “ Have you not left the goose stillhanging in its place? What wonder is it that thestorm has prevented your departure? Put it immediately into the caldron, and boil and eat it, that the seamay become tranquil, and you may return home.”They immediately did as he had commanded; and ithappened most wonderfully that the moment the kettlebegan to boil, the wind began to cease, and the wavesto be still. Having ﬁnished their repast, and seeingthat the sea was calm, they went on board, and, to theirgreat delight, though with shame for their neglect,reached home with a fair wind. Their shame arosefrom their disobedience and dulness of comprehension,whereby, amid the chastening of their Maker, theywere unable to perceive and to correct their error.They rejoiced, because they now saw what care Godhad for his faithful servant, so as to vindicate himfrom neglect, even by means of the elements. Theyrejoiced, too, that the Lord should have had so muchregard to themselves, as to correct their oﬂ'ences evenby an open miracle. Now this, which I have related, Idid not pick up from any chance authority, but I had itfrom one of those who were present,—a most reverendmonk and priest of the same monastery, Cynemund,</p>

A&amp; crowd of monks were standing byas he entered into the ship; andmonk, strong in faith but weak inbody, in consequence of a dysentery, said to him, “ Tellus, my lord bishop, when we may hope for yourreturn.” To this plain question, he replied as plainly,“When you shall bring my body back here.” Whenhe had passed about two months in the enjoyment ofhis rest, and had as usual subdued both his body andmind with his accustomed severity, he was suddenlyseized with illness, and began to prepare for the joy ofeverlasting happiness, through pain and temporal afﬂiction. I will describe his death in the words of him whorelated it to me, namely, his attendant priest Hereﬁ'id,a most religious man, who also at that time presidedover the monastery of Lindisfarne, in the capacity ofabbot.“ He was brought to the point of death,” said he,“aﬁer having been weakened by three weeks of continuedsuﬁ'ering. For he was taken ill on the fourth day ofthe week; and again on the fourth day of the week hispains were over, and he departed to the Lord. Butwhen I came to him on the ﬁrst morning after his illness began—(for I had also arrived at the island with1</p>

Nec plura interrogans, “Da,” inquam, "benedictionem nobis, quia jam tempus navigandi, ac domum repetendi adest." “Facite,” inquit,“ ut dicis, ascendite navem, ac domum salvi redite.Cum autem Deus susceperit animam meam, sepelite mein hac mansione juxta oratorium meum ad meridiem,contra orientalem plagam sanctæ crucis, quam ibidemerexi.

    <p>the brethren three days before)—in my desire to obtainhis blessing and advice as usual, I gave the customarysignal of my coming, and he came to the window, andreplied to my salutation with a sigh. ‘ My lordbishop,’ said I, ‘what is the matter with you? Hasyour indisposition come upon you this last night ?’—‘Yes,’ said he, ‘indisposition has come upon me.’ Ithought that he was speaking of an old complaint,which vexed him almost every day, and not of a newmalady ; so, without making any more inquiries, I saidto him, ‘ Give us your blessing, for it is time to put tosea and return home.’—‘ Do so,’ replied he; ‘go onboard, and return home in safety. But, when the Lordshall have taken my spirit, bury me in this house, nearmy oratory, towards the south, over-against the easternside of the holy cross, which I have erected there.Towards the north side of that same oratory is a sarcophagus under the turf, which the venerable AbbotCudda formerly gave me. You will place my bodytherein, wrapping it in linen, which you will ﬁnd in it.I would not wear it whilst I was alive, but for the loveof that highly favoured woman, who sent it to me, theAbbess Verca, I have preserved it to wrap my corpsein.’ On Hearing these words, I replied, ‘I beseechyou, father, as you are weak, and talk of the probabilityof your dying, to let some of the brethren remain hereto wait on you.’—‘ Go home now,’ said be; ‘butreturn at the proper time.’ So I was unable to prevailupon him, notwithstanding the urgency of my entreaties ; and at last I asked him when we should return tohim. ‘ When God so wills it,’ said he, ‘ and when HeHimself shall direct you.’ We did as he commandedus; and having assembled the brethren immediately inthe church, I had prayers offered up for him withoutintermission; ‘ for,’ said I, ‘it seems to me, from somewords which he spoke, that the day is approaching onwhich he will depart to the Lord.’</p>
    <p>‘ Eram autem sollicitus de reditu propter infirmitatemejus, sed quinque diebus obstitit tempestas, ne redirepogsemus; quod divinitus dispensatum fuisse rei probavit eventus. Ut enim Omnipotens Deus famulumsuum ab omni labe mundanæ fragilitatis ad purum castigaret, utque adversariis ejus, quam nihil contra fideifortitudinem valerent, ostenderet, voluit cum tanto tempore segregatum ab hominibus, et suæ carnis dolore etantiqui hostis acriori certamine probari.

    <p>“ I was anxious about returning to him on account ofhis illness, but the weather prevented us for ﬁve days;and it was ordered so by God, as the event showed.For God Almighty, wishing to cleanse his servant fromevery stain of earthly weakness, and to show his adver—saries how weak they were against the strength of hisfaith, kept him aloof from men, and put him to theproof by pains of the ﬂesh, and still more violent encounters with the ancient enemy. At length there wasa calm, and we went to the island, and found him awayfrom his cell in the house where we were accustomed toreside. The brethren who came with me had someoccasion to go back to the neighbouring shore, so thatI was left alone on the island to minister to the holyfather. I warmed some water and washed his feet,which had an ulcer from a long swelling, and, from thequantity of blood that came from it, required to beattended to. I also warmed some wine which I hadbrought, and begged him to taste it; for I saw by hisface that he was worn out with pain and want of food.When I had ﬁnished my service, he sat down quietlyon the couch, and I sat down by his side.“ Seeing that'he kept silence, I said, ‘ I see, my lordbishop, that you have suffered much from your complaint since we left you, and I marvel that you were sounwilling for us, when we departed, to send you someof our number to wait upon you.’ He replied, ‘ It wasdone by the providence and the will of God, that I mightbe left without any society or aid of man, and suffer somewhat of aﬁiiction. For when you were gone, my languorbegan to increase, so that I left my cell and came hitherto meet any one who might be on his way to see me,that he might not have the trouble of going further.Now, from the moment of my coming until the presenttime, during a space of ﬁve days and ﬁve nights, I havesat here without moving.’—‘And how have you supported life, my lord bishop?’ asked I; ‘have you re</p>

Annuit ille, et quosdam nostrum secumretinuit, in quibus erat major Beda presbyter, qui ministerio ejus familiariter semper adesse, consueverat.Ideoque donationum acceptationumque ejus omniumconscius erat indubius, quem ob id maxime secummanere voluit, ut si cujuslibet acceptis muneribus dignarecompensatione non respondissent, illius admonitionerecoleret et, priusquam obiret, sua cuique restitueret.Sed et alium quendam de fratribus specialiter, ut interministros sibi adesset, designavit; qui longo quidemventris fluxu graviter ægrotabat, neque a. medicis poterat curari; sed merito religionis, prudentiæ, et gravitatisdignus exstiterat, qui testis esset verborum, quæ vir Deiultima diceret, vel quo ordine migraret ad Dominum.‘ Interea rediens domum narrabam fratribus, quiavenerabilis pater in sua se insula sepeliri juberet. “ Etvidetur,” inquam, “ mihi justius esse et multo dignius impetrare ab eo, quatenus huc transferri corpus suum, etjuxta honorem congruum in ecclesia condi, permittat."Placuerunt illis quæ dixeram, et venientes ad episcopum rogabamus, dicentes, “Non ausi sumus, domineepiscope, contemnere jussionem tuam, qua te hic tumulari mandasti, et tamen rogandum videbatur nobis, ut</p>
    <p>mained so long without taking food ?, Upon which,turning up the couch on which he was sitting, he showedme ﬁve onions concealed therein, saying, ‘ This has beenmy food for ﬁve days; for, whenever my mouth becamedry and parched with thirst, I cooled and refreshed myself by tasting these ;’-—now one of the onions appearedto have been a little gnawed, but certainly not more thanhalf of it was eaten;—‘and,’ continued he, ‘my enemies have never persecuted me so much during mywhole stay in the island, as they have done duringthese last ﬁve days.’ I was not bold enough to askwhat kinds of persecutions he had suffered: I onlyasked him to have some one to wait upon him. Heconsented, and kept some of us with him; amongstwhom was the priest Bede the elder, who had alwaysbeen used to familiar attendance upon him. This manwas consequently a most faithful witness of every thingwhich he gave or received, whom Cuthbert wished tokeep with him, to remind him if he did not make propercompensation for any presents which he might receive,that before he died he might renderto every one hisown. He kept also another of the brethren with him,who had long suffered from a violent diarrhea, andcould not be cured by the physicians; but, for his religious merit, and prudent conduct, and grave demeanour,was thought worthy to hear the last words of the manof God, and to witness his departure to the Lord.“ Meanwhile I returned home, and told the brethrenthat the holy father wished to be buried in his ownisland; and I added my opinion, that it would be moreproper and becoming to. obtain his consent for his bodyto be transported from the island, and buried in themonastery with the usual honours. My words pleasedthem, and we went to the bishop, and asked him, saying, ‘We have not dared, my lord bishop, to despiseyour injunction to be buried here, and yet we havethought proper to request of you permission to transY</p>

He went in accordingly, and stayed till the ninth hour: when he cameout, and said to me, ‘ The bishop wishes you to go inunto him; but I have a most wonderful thing to tellyou: from the moment of my touching the bishop,when I supported him into the oratory, I have beenentirely free from my old complaint.’ No doubt thiswas brought abbut by the effect of his heavenly piety,that, whereas in his time of health and strength he hadhealed many, he should now heal this man, when hewas himself at the point of death, that so there mightbe a standing proof how strong the holy man was inspirit, though his body was at the lowest degree ofweakness. In this cure he followed the example of theholy and reverend father and bishop, Aurelius Augustine, who, when weighed down by the illness of whichhe died, and lying on his couch, was entreated by aman to lay his hand on a sick person whom he hadbrought to him, that so he might be made well. Towhich Augustine replied, ‘ If I had such power, Ishould first have practised it towards myself.’ Thesick man answered, ‘ I have been commanded to cometo you: for some one said to me in a dream, Go toBishop Augustine, and let him place his hand uponyou, and you shall be well.’ On hearing this, Augustine placed his hand upon him, gave him his blessing,and sent him home perfectly recovered.CHAP.

    <p>before the altar. I took my seat by his side, but hespoke very little, for the weight of his suffering prevented him from speaking much. But when I earnestlyasked him what last discourse and valedictory salutationhe would bequeath to the brethren, he began to make afew strong admonitione respecting peace and humility,and told me to beware of those persons who stroveagainst these virtues, and would not practise them.‘ Have peace,’ said he, ‘ and Divine charity ever amongstyou: and when you are called upon to deliberate onyour condition, see that you be unanimous in council.Let concord be mutual between you and other servantsof Christ; and do not despise others who belong to thefaith and come to you for hospitality, but admit themfamiliarly and kindly; and when you have entertainedthem, speed them on their journey: by no meansesteeming yourselves better than the rest of those whopartake of the same faith and mode of life. But haveno communion With those who err from the unity ofthe Catholic faith, either by keeping Easter at au improper time, or by their perverse life. And know andremember, that, if of two evils you are compelled tochoose one, I would rather that you should take up mybones, and leave these places, to reside wherever Godmay send you, than consent in any way to the wickedness of schismatics, and so place a yoke upon yournecks.

XL.— now, ACCORDING 'ro nm pnavxousWARNING OF THE PSALMI WHICH THEY SANG ATms DEATH, THE BRETHREN op LINDISFARNE WEREAsSAxLED FROM WITHOUT, BUT BY THE HELP OFeon WERE pno'mc'mn.“ I IMMEDIATELY went out, and told the brethren,who had passed the whole night in watchfulness andprayer, and chanced at that moment in the order ofevening-service to be singing the 59th Psalm, whichbegins, ‘ O Lord, thou hast rejected us and destroyedus; thou hast been angry, and hast pitied us.’ One ofthem instantly lighted two candles, and, holding one ineach hand, ascended a lofty spot, to show to the bre—thren who were in the monastery of Lindisfarne, thatthe holy man was dead; for they had agreed beforehand that such a signal should be made. The brother,who had waited an hour on an opposite height in theisland of Lindisfarne, ran with speed to the monastery,where the brethren were assembled to perform the usualceremonies of the evening—service, and happened to besinging the above-named Psalm when the messengerentered. This was a Divine dispensation, as the event</p>

He healed those whowere contrite in heart, and bound up their bruises, sothat it was then given openly to understand the meaning of the hymn which was then for the ﬁrst time sung,when the death of the sainted man was known ; namely,that after his death his countrymen should be exposedto be repulsed and destroyed, but after a demonstrationof his threatening anger should again be protected bythe Divine mercy. He who considers the sequel alsoof the above—named Psalm will perceive that the eventcorresponded to its meaning. The body of the venerable father was placed on board a ship, and carried tothe island of Lindisfame.

A priest from themonastery was sent to the sufferer; but, though he hadbeen accustomed to exorcise and expel evil spirits, yetin this case he could not prevail: he therefore advisedthe lad’s father to put him into a cart and drive him tothe monastery, and to pray to God in his behalf beforethe relics of the holy saints which are there. Thefather did as he was advised; but the holy saints, toshow how high a place Cuthbert occupied amongstthem, refused to bestow on him the beneﬁt desired.The mad boy, therefore, by howling, groaning, andgnashing his teeth, ﬁlled the eyes and ears of all whowere there with horror, and no one could think of anyremedy; when, behold, one of the priests, being taughtin spirit that by the aid of the holy father Cuthbert hemight be cured, went privately to the place where heknew the water had been thrown, in which his deadbody had been washed; and taking from thence a smallportion of the dirt, be mixed it with some water, andcarrying it to the sufferer, poured it into his openmouth, from which he was uttering the most horribleand lamentable cries. He instantly held his tongue,closed his mouth, and shutting his eyes also, whichbefore were bloodshot and staring hideously, he fell .back into a profound sleep. In this state he passedthe night ; and in the morning, rising up from his slumber, free from his madness, he found himself also, bythe merits and intercession of the blessed Cuthbert,free from the evil spirit by which he had been aﬂiicted.It was a marvellous sight, and delectable to all good "men, to see the son sound in mind accompany hisfather to the holy places, and give thanks for the aid ofthe saints; although the day before, from the extremityof his madness, he did not know who or where he was.When, in the midst of the whole body of the brethren</p>

Theyshow to this day the pit into which that memorablewater was thrown, of a square shape, surrounded withwood, and ﬁlled with little stones. It is near the churchin which his body reposes, on the south side. Fromthat time God permitted many other cures to be wroughtby means of those same stones, and the dirt from thesame place.CHAP. XLII.—How His BODY AFTER. NINE YEARSWAS FOUND UNDECAYED.Now Divine Providence, wishing to show to whatglory this holy man was exalted after death, who evenbefore death had been distinguished by so many signsand miracles, inspired the minds of the brethren with awish to remove his bones, which they expected to ﬁnddry and free from his decayed ﬂesh, and to put them ina small coﬂ‘er, on the same spot, above the ground, asobjects of veneration to the people.’ This wish theycommunicated to the holy Bishop Eadbert about themiddle of Quadragesima ; and he ordered them toexecute this on the 20th of April, which was the anniversary of the day of his burial. They accordingly didso; and opening the tomb, found his body entire, as ifhe were still alive, and his joints were still ﬂexible, as ifhe were not dead, but sleeping. His clothes, also, werestill undecayed, and seemed to retain their originalfreshness and colour. When the brethren saw this,</p>

In hoc etenimsemper Quadragesimæ tempus agere, in hoc quadragintaante Dominicum natale dies in magna continentiæ, orationis, et lacrimarum devotione ducere consueverat. Inquo etiam venerabilis prædecessor ejus Cuthbertus, priusquam Fame peteret, sicut et supra docuimus, aliquamdiu secretus Domino militabat. Attulerunt autem etpartem indumentorum, quæ corpus sanctum circumdederant. Quæ cum ille et munera gratanter acciperet, etmiracula libenter audiret, nam et ipsa indumenta quasipatris adhuc corpori circumdata miro deosculabaturaﬁ'ectu: “ Nova,” inquit, "indumenta corpori pro his,quæ tulistis, circumdata, et sic reponite in theca, quamparastis.

Et beatus est multum, cui in eo sedemquiescendi Dominus veræ beatitudinis auctor atque largitor concedere dignatur." Adjecitque mirando, quaquondam versibus dixi, et ait,“ Quis Domini expediet cælestia munera dictis,Vel paradisiacas quæ capit auris opes?Dum pius, infesti disrupta pondere leti,Vivere siderea semper in arce dabit ;Mortua nunc tanto qui membra decorat honore,Pulchraque perpetuæ pignora præstat opis.Quamque beata domus, sub tanto quæ hospite fulges,Nescia quæ leti, lumine læta micas!</p>
    <p>they were so astonished, that they could scarcely speak,or look on the miracle which lay before them, and theyhardly knew what they were doing.As a proof of the uncorrupted state of the clothes,they took a portion of them from one of the extremi—ties,—for they did not dare to take any from the bodyitselﬂ—and hastened to tell what they had found to thebishop, who was then walking alone at a sþot remotefrom the monastery, and closed in by the ﬂowing wavesof the sea. Here it was his custom to pass the Quadragesima; and here he occupied himself forty daysbefore the birthday of our Lord in the utmost devotion,accompanied with abstinence, prayer, and tears. Here,also, his venerable predecessor, Cuthbert, before he wentto Fame, as we have related, spent a portion of hisspiritual warfare in the service of the Lord. The hrethren brought with them, also, the piece of cloth inwhich the body of the saint had been wrapped. Thebishop thanked them for the giﬁ, and heard their report with eagerness, and with great earnestness kissedthe cloth as if it were still on the saint’s body. “ Faldup the body,” said he, “ in new cloth instead of this,and place it in the chest which you have prepared.But I know of a certainty that the place which hasbeen consecrated by the virtue of this heavenly miraclewill not long remain empty ; and happy is he to whomthe Lord, who is the giver of true happiness, shall grantto rest therein.” To these words he added what I haveelsewhere expressed in verse, and said,—“ What man the wondrous gifts of God shall tell?What ear the joys of paradise shall bear?Triumphant o’er the gates of death and hell,The just shall live amid the starry sphere,” &amp;c.</p>

He therebent his knees at the tomb of the holy father, and, withhis head stooping towards the ground, prayed for hisrecovery ; when, suddenly, he felt in all his limbs suchan accession of strength from the incorruptible body ofthe saint, that he rose up from prayer without trouble,and returned to the guests’ chamber without the assistance of the conductor who had led him, or the staff onwhich he had leaned.

    <p>CHAP. XLV.—How A PARALYTIC WAS HEALED BYMEANS op ms sumas.THERE was a young man in a monastery not far03; who had lost the use of all his limbs by a weakness which the Greeks call paralysis. His abbot,knowing that there were skilful physicians in the monas—tery of Lindisfarne, sent him thither with a requestthat, if possible, he might be healed. The brethren,at the instance of their own abbot and bishop also,attended to him with the utmost care, and used alltheir skill in medicine, but without effect, for the maladyincreased daily, insomuch that, save his month, he couldhardly move a single limb. Being thus given over byall worldly physicians, he had recourse to Him who isin heaven, who, when He is sought out in truth, iskind towards all our iniquities, and heals all our sicknesses. The poor man begged of his attendant to bringhim something which had come from the incorruptiblebody of the holy man; for he believed that by meansthereof he might, with the blessing of God, return tohealth. The attendant, having ﬁrst consulted the abbot, brought the shoes which the man of God had wornin the tomb, and having stripped the poor man’s feetnaked, put them upon him; for it was in his feet thatthe palsy had ﬁrst attacked him. This he did at thebeginning of the night, when bedtime was drawingnear. A deep sleep immediately came over him; andas the stillness of night advanced, the man felt a palpitation in his feet alternately, so that the attendants,who were awake and looking on, perceived that thevirtue of the holy man’s relics was beginning to exertits power, and that the desired restoration of healthwould ascend upwards from the feet. As soon as the. monastery bell struck the hour of midnight prayer, the</p>

    <p>invalid himself was awakened by the sound and sat up.He found his nerves and the joints of his limbs suddenly endowed with inward strength: his pains weregone ; and perceiving that he was cured, he arose, andin a standing posture spent the whole time of the midnight or matin song in thanksgiving to God. In themorning he went- to the cathedral, and in the sight ofall the congratulating brethren he went round all thesacred places, offering up prayers and the sacriﬁce ofpraise to his Saviour. Thus it came to pass, that, by amost wonderful vicissitude of things, he, who had beencarried thither weak and home upon a cart, returnedhome sound in his own strength, and with all his limbsstrengthened and conﬁrmed. Wherefore it is proﬁtableto bear in mind that this change was the work of theright hand of the Most High, whose mighty miraclesnever cease from the beginning of the world to showthemselves forth to mankind.CHAP.

There is no reason why it may notbe attributed to either of the two, in conjunction withthe faith of the most holy father Felgeld; throughwhom and in whom the miraculous cure, which I mention, was effected. He was the third person who be</p>

Sed vir venerabilis, quicælestis aedificii magis quam terreni decorem quærebat,sumto fæno, vel argilla, vel quicquid hujusmodi materiæreperisset, stipaverat rimulas, ne quotidianis imbriumsive ventorum injuriis ab orandi retardantur instantia.Cum hæc igitur Ethelwaldus ingressus locum vidisset,postulavit a frequentantibus ae fratribus pelliculam vituli,eamque illo in angulo, quo et ipse et' predecessor ejusCuthbertua sæpius orans stare vel genuﬂectere solebat,clavis affixum violentiis procellarum opposuit.At postquam ipse quoque, expletis ibi duodecim continuis annis, gaudium supernæ beatitudinis intravit, actertius locum eundem Felgeldus inhabitare coepit, placuit reverendissimo Lindisfarnensis ecclesiæ pontificiEadfrido, dissolutum vetustate oratorium illuda fundamentis restaurare.

    <p>came tenant of the same place and its spiritual warfare,and, at present more than seventy years old, is awaiting the end of this life, in expectation of the heavenlyone.When, therefore, God’s servant Cuthbert had beentranslated to the heavenly kingdom, and Ethelwald hadcommenced his occupation of the same island and monastery, after many years spent in conversation with themonks, he gradually aspired to the rank of anachoritishperfection. The walls of the aforesaid oratory, beingcomposed of planks somewhat carelessly put together,had become loose and tottering by age, and, as theplank: separated from one another, an opening wasaﬁ‘orded to the weather. The venerable man, whoseaim was rather the splendour of the heavenly than ofau earthly mansion, having taken hay, or clay, or whatever he could get, had ﬁlled up the crevices, that hemight not be disturbed from the earnestness of hisprayers by the daily violence of the winds and storms.When Ethelwald entered and saw these contrivances,he begged the brethren who came thither to give him acalf’s skin, and fastened it with nails in the corner,where himself and his predecessor used to kneel orstand when they prayed, as a protection against thestorm.Twelve years after, he also ascended to the joys ofthe heavenly kingdom, and Felgeld became the thirdinhabitant of the place. It then seemed good to theright reverend Eadfrid, bishop of the church of Lindisfame, to restore from its foundation the time-worn oratory. This being done, many devout persona begged ofChrist’s holy servant Felgeld to give them a small portion of the relics of God’s servant Cuthbert, or of Ethelwald his successor. He accordingly determined to cutup the above-named calf’s skin into pieces, and give aportion to each. But he ﬁrst experienced its inﬂuencein his own person: for his face was much deformed by</p>

At cum in solitudine remotusminorem corpori cultum, majorem adhiberet continentiam, et quasi diutino carcere inclusus, rarius vel fotusolis, vel aeris uteretur aﬂiatu, excrevit languor inmaj us, faciemque totam tumenti ardore replevit. Timensergo, ne forte magnitudine hujusmodi infirmitatis solitariam deserere vitam, et communem necesse essetconversationem repetere, fideli usus est præsumtione,speravitque se illorum ope curandum, quorum se mansionem tenere et vitam gaudebat-imitari. Mittens enimpræfatæ partem' pelliculæ in'aquam, ipsa aqua lavitsuam faciem, statimque tumor omnis, qui hanc obsederat, et scabies fæda recessit; juxta quod mihi etprimo religiosus quidam presbyter hujus monasteriiGirvensis indicavit, qui se vultum illius et prius tumentem ac deformem nosse, et postea mundatum per fenestram manu palpasse, referebat; et ipse postmodumFelgeldus retulit, astruens quia res ita, ut presbyternarraverat, esset expleta, et quod ex eo tempore, cuminclusus per multa annorum curricula maneret, utprius, immunem ab hujusmodi molestia vultum semperhaberet; agente gratia Dei omnipotentis, quae et inpræsenti multos et in futuro omnes cordis et corporisnostri languores sanare consuevit, satiansque in bonisdesiderium nostrum, sun nos in perpetuum misericordiaet miseratione coronat.

    <p>a swelling and a red patch. The symptoms of thisdeformity had become manifest long before to themonks, whilst he was dwelling among them. But nowthat he was living alone, and bestowed less care on hisperson, whilst he practised still greater rigidities, and,like a prisoner, rarely enjoyed the sun or air, the maladyincreased, and his face became one large red swelling.Fearing, therefore, lest he should be obliged to abandonthe solitary life and return to the monastery; presumingin his faith, be trusted to heal himself by the aid ofthose holy men whose. house he dwelt in, end whoseholy life he sought to imitate. For he steeped a pieceof the skin above mentioned in water, and washed hisface therewith; whereupon the swelling was immediately healed, and the cicatrice disappeared. This I wastold, in the ﬁrst instance, by a religious priest of themonastery of Jarrow, who said that he well knew Felgeld’s face to have been in the deformed and diseasedstate which I have described, and that he saw it andfelt it with his hand through the window after it wascured. Felgeld afterwards told me the same thing,conﬁrming the report of the priest, and asserting thathis face was ever afterwards free from the blemishduring the many years that he passed in that place.This be ascribed to the agency of the Almighty Grace,which both in this world heals many, and in the worldto come will heal all the maladies of our minds andbodies, and, satisfying our desires after good things,crown us for ever with its mercy and compassion.AMEN.

The venerableand devout king of that nation,ngrid, contributed the land; and Biscop, for thespace of sixteen years, amid innumerable perils in journeying and in illness, ruled this monastery with thesame piety which stirred him up to build it. If I mayuse the words of the blessed Pope Gregory, in whichhe glorifica the life of the abbot of the same name, hewas a man of a venerable life, blessed (Benedictus) bothin grace and in name; having the mind of an adulteven from his childhood, surpassing his age by hismanners, and with a soul addicted to no false pleasures.He was descended from &amp; noble lineage of the Angles,and by corresponding dignity of mind worthy to beexalted into the company of the angels. Lastly, he wasthe minister of King Oswy, and by his gift enjoyed anestate suitable to his rank; but at the age of twenty</p>

Ad patriam mox reversus, studiosius ea quævidit ecclesiasticæ vitæ instituta, diligere, venerari,et quibus potuit prædicare, non desiit.

Quem cumpater suus ab intentione memorati itineris revocaret,atque in patria ac regno suo faceret residere, nihilominus ipse, ut bonæ indolis adolescens, coeptum confestim explens iter, summa sub festinatione Romamrediit, tempore cujus supra beatæ memoriæ Vitalianipapæ; et non pauca scientiæ salutaris, quemadmodumet prius, hausta dulcedine, post menses aliquot indedigrediens ad insulam Lirinensem, ibidem se monacho—rum cætui tradidit, tonsuram accepit, .et disciplinam</p>
    <p>ﬁve years he despised a transitory wealth, that he mightobtain that which is eternal. He made light of a temporal warfare with a donative that will decay, that hemight serve under the true King, and earn an everlasting kingdom in the heavenly city. He leii; his home,his kinsmen and country, for the sake of Christ and hisGospel, that he might receive a hundredfold and enjoyeverlasting life: he disdained to submit to carnal nuptials, that he might be able to follow the Lamb brightwith the glory of chastity in the heavenly kingdoms:he reﬁned to be the father of mortal children in theﬂesh, being fore-ordaiued of Christ to educate for Himin spiritual doctrine immortal children in heaven.‘v AVING therefore left his country,5' i he came to Rome, and took care' .

At this timeAlfrid, son of the above-named King Oswy, beingabout to visit Rome, to' worehip at the gates of the holyApostles, took him as the companion of his journey.When the king, his father, diverted him from this intention, and made him reside in his own country andkingdom; yet, like a youth of good promise, accomplishing the journey which he had undertaken, Biscopreturned with the greatest expedition to Rome, in thetime of Pope Vitalian, of blessed memory; and therehaving" extracted no little sweetness of wholesome learning, as he had done previously, after some months hewent to the island of Lerins, where he joined himself tothe company of monks, received the tonsure, and, having 'A a</p>

    <p>taken the vow, observed the regular discipline with duesolicitude; and when he had for two years been instructed in the suitable learning of the monastic life, 'he determined, in love for that ﬁrst of the Apostles, St.Peter, to return to the city which was hallowed by hisremains.Not long aner, a merchant vessel-arrived, which enabled him to gratify his Wish. At that time, Egbert,king of Kent, had sent out of Britain a man who hadbeen elected to the office of bishop, Wighard by name,who had been adequately taught by the Roman disciplesof the blessed Pope Gregory in Kent on every topicof Church discipline; but the king wished him to beordained bishop at Rome, in order that, having him for. bishop of his own nation and language, he might himself, as well as his people, be the more thoroughlymaster of the words and mysteries of the holy faith,as he would then have these administered, not throughan interpreter, but from the hands and by the tongue ofa kiusman and fellow-countryman. But Wighard, oncoming to Rome, died of a disease, with all his attendants, before he had received the dignity of bishop. Nowthe Apostolic Father, that the embassy of the faithfulmight not fail through the death of their ambassadors,called a council, and appointed one of his Church tosend as archbishop into Britain. This was Theodore, aman deep in all secular and ecclesiastical learning, Whether Greek or Latin; and to him was given, as a colleague and counsellor, a man equally strenuous andprudent, the abbot Hadrian. Perceiving also that thereverend Benedict would become a man of wisdom, industry, piety, and nobility of mind, he committed tohim the newly ordained bishop, with his followers, enjoining him to abandon the travel which he had under—taken for Christ’s sake; and with a higher good in view,to return home to his country, and bring into it thatteacher of wisdom whom it had so earnestly wishedA a 2</p>

    <p>for, and to be to him an interpreter and guide, bothon the journey thither, and afterwards, upon his arrival,when he should begin to preach. Benedict did as hewas commanded ; they came to Kent, and were joyfullyreceived there; Theodore ascended his episcopal throne,and Benedict took upon himself to rule the monasteryof the blessed Apostle Peter, of which, afterwards,Hadrian became abbot.He ruled the monastery for two years; and then successfully, as before, accomplished a third voyage fromBritain to Rome, and brought back a large number ofbooks on sacred literature, which he had either boughtat a price or received as gifts from his friends. On his‘i-eturn he arrived at Vienne, where he took possessionof such as he had entrusted his friends to purchase forhim. When he had come home, he determined to goto the court of Conwalh, king of the West Saxons,whose friendship and services he had already m0re thanonce experienced. But Conwalh died suddenly aboutthis'time, and he therefore directed his course to hisnative province. He came to the court of ngrid,king of Northumberland, and gave an account of allthat he had done since in youth he hac! left his country.He made no secret of his zeal for religion, and showedwhat ecclesiastical or monastic instructions he had received at Rome and elsewhere. He displayed the holyvolumes and relics of Christ’s blessed Apostles and martyrs, which he had brought, and found such favour inthe eyes of the king, that he forthwith gave him seventyhides of land out of his own estates, and ordered amonastery to be built thereon for the ﬁrst pastor of hischurch. This was done, as I said before, at the mouthof the river Were, on the left bank, in the 674th yearof our Lord’s incarnation, in the second indictiou, andin the fourth year of King ngrid’s reign.</p>
