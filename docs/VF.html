Rejoieed at this gia; of Divine love, he gatheredthe bunch of grapes, and pressed it to the mouth of the,dying prelate; but his teeth were closed as if in death,all sensation of his heart and breath had ceased, andhe was unable to receive that which was oﬂ‘ered to him.At length the pious priest by good fortune forced openhis parched lips, and poured into his mouth as much ofthe juice of the grape as he was able. The father, atthe taste, recovered both sensation and breath: his eyesopened, and his tongue, which had stuck to his drypalate, attempted to articulate words. After some timehe revived, and seeing that it was Felix who had cometo seek him, embraced him with paternal love, andasked him why he had come so late, saying, “ Wherehave you ﬁngered so long, my son? for God promisedme some time ago that you should come. But you seethat, though I yield for the moment, I have faithfullypreserved my ﬁrmness of mind, as the place of myretreat clearly proves. I might have ﬂed to some village or city, where I should have been safe; if my faithhad been of no value to me, or less dear than life. But,you see, I have avoided all the haunts of men, and haveﬂed to the mountains, trusting myself to the grace andprotection of God, that, according to his good pleasure,He might preserve me for this life or exalt me to abetter. Nor did my trust in God deceive me, as itproved by your coming, which has recalled me, so tospeak, from death to life. Wherefore, my son, ﬁnishyour work of piety; place me on your shoulders, andcarry me home.”CHAP.

Felix aroused her byknocking at the door, and when she opened the doorhe committed the bishop to her care. The bishopthanked the holy Felix for his labour of love, andplacing his right hand upon his head, gave him hisfatherly blessing. The priest, departing, concealed himself in the same way for a few days in his own house,until the storm of persecution had passed over. Assoon as this happened, he left his concealment, andrestored himself to the sight of his congratulating citizens. He went about everywhere, consoling and conﬁrming their minds with words of exhortation; for,during the bitterness of the late persecution, they hadbeen terribly cast down. He taught them not only byhis word, but by his example, to despise the prosperities and adversities of this world, and to seek only thejoys of the heavenly country, to fear alone the anger ofthe heavenly J udge.

The prudent man perceivedthat it was the work of God, and replied, smiling, “ Ido not know the man you are looking for.” And inthis he spoke the truth; for nobody does know himself.Upon this, the persecutore turned their attention elsewhere, and asked those whom they met where Felixwas. One of them, by chance, ignorant of their motives, and thinking they were out of their wits, beganto reprove them for their folly in not knowing the manthey had been talking to, and at the same time pointedout to them where he was gone. Fired to madness,they rushed after Felix, who, warned of their comingby the multitude of citizens that preceded, and by theclamours of the people, who were confounded at theenemy’s approach, withdrew to a secret place, whichhad no other defence than a fragment of a haIf-ruinedwall. No sooner, however, had the man of God, entered that place, than he was protected by a work ofthe Divine hand; for a mound of rubbish suddenlyarose and closed in the place, and a spider, by Divinewarning, immediately hung its ﬂoating web on the abandoned spot. The adversaries approached, and haltedin awe, saying among themselves, “ Is it not foolish forus to look for any one in this place? It is quite clearthat no one has been here before ourselves ; for, if anyone had entered, these spider’s webs could not haveremained whole, for even the smallest ﬂies will sometimes break through them. The man who told us hewas here must have done so deceitfully, to delay uslonger from ﬁnding him. Let us return, and refrainfrom searching this place, the very appearance of whichshows that no one has been here before us.” Thusfoiled, they retraced their steps in anger, and ﬁred withequal rage against him who had by his deceit led them tothe place to witness the wisdom of our pious Creator andN 2</p>

Surely the highest walls sometimes betraya beleaguered city, as well as defend it; for Christ protected his humble servant from detection and imprisonment at the hands of his armed enemies by a frailspider’s web, as the venerable father Paulinus says trulyori this subject,—“ Where Christ is with us, a spider’sweb our wall shall be; where Christ is not, our wall aspider’s web shall be.” The evening was approachingwhen his enemies departed; and 'Felix, when they weregone, withdrew to a safer place of refuge, rejoicing inthe Divine protection, and singing within himself,—,“Though I should walk in the midst of the shadow ofdeath, I will not fear evil, for Thou art with me.” Whenday dawned, he withdrew to a more retired place among.the buildings of the city, where for six whole months helived apart from men, relying on the protection of theDivine presence, according to the words of the Psalmist,—“ His countenance was hidden from the feat ofmen;” and Providence fed him during this long spaceof time in a manner wonderful and unknown to men.For in a neighbouring house there lived a devoutwoman, whose services, though she was unconscious ofthe matter, the Lord, Who is the fountain and origin ofall knowledge, made use of to accomplish his designs.This woman used to bake bread and cook other pro.visions in her own bakehouse, and unwittingly carrythem to the place Where Felix was concealed, where shelaid them down in such a way that he took them, andshe never knew that she had either come or gone away;and believing that the food which she had prepared wasat home, she always forgot that she had put it there,but never forgot to bring it. Thus they say the holyfather remained for the space of six months in thisobscure and narrow residence, apart from the society ofmen, but not abandoned by Heaven ; and thus also hewas fed on humble fare, but ministered to him by theAlmighty.</p>

For the mercifulAuthor of our salvation, who, when all around was dry,caused the ﬂeece to drop with water, sent down fromheaven, through the still and bright sky, a secret rainto refresh his fainting servant. At the end of sixmonths he was admonished by Divine Providence tocome forth from his retirement, as the fury of the persecution had now ceased. As soon as he appeared inpublic, he was received by all with congratulations, asif he was come from paradise ; and he began from timeto time to conﬁrm their faith, which had been muchshaken by the persecution. Meanwhile, God’s chosenservant, Bishop Maximus, died at an extreme old age,and Felix was at once, with the consent of all, electedto the bishopric. This most worthy confessor andteacher of the faith faithfully enacted in his own conduct the precepts which he had taught. But, to showwhat exalted humility was in his heart, be excused himself from undertaking this ofﬁce, saying, that his fellowpriest, Quintus, was more worthy of it than himself,because he had been raised to priest’s orders sevendays before himself. This suggestion was adopted, andQuintus was made bishop; but he, with great humility,deferred in every thing to Felix, and caused him todeliver the sermon to the people instead of himself;and whilst he ruled, as far as regarded outward authority, Felix was the fountain-head of doctrine.

For he originally possessed, by inheritance from his father, many farms and houses, andmuch money: but when he was proscribed during thepersecution, he lost all. When peace was restored tothe Church, and he had it in his power to resume hisrights, he would not do so. His friends tried to persuade him that he might reclaim them with much interest, and spend the money, or give it to the poor; buthe would not be prevailed on, saying, “All things arelawful, but all things are not expedient; far be it fromme that I should set about recovering my earthly possessions, as if those in heaven, which I have preferredto them, are not sufﬁcient. Rather let me be poor, andfollow in spirit aﬁer J esus, that I may reap a moreabundant reward in his heavenly kingdom. Nor do Idoubt that He who saved me from chains, and the darkprison, and so long sustained me away from the face ofmen, will feed me through the rest of my life if I castall my care upon Him.” Such was the humility of theholy father: he would only take back a little garden ashis own property, and three acres of land, for which hepaid a rent.CHAP.

These oxen, which he took greatcare of, were one night stolen; and their owner, in themorning, when he discovered the loss, without the slightest idea of searching for and ﬁnding them, ran to thechurch of St. Felix, where he threw himself prostrateon the ground before the doors of the sacred house;and, ﬁxing his eyes on the earth, besought the holyman to restore him his oxen which he had lost, andvowed never to leave the church until he should recover them. He remained there all the day, utteringcries which savoured of a rustic dialect, but nevertheless evinced the faith which was in his heart. Whenevening came on he was ejected by the multitude, andthrust out of the sacred ediﬁce. He then returnedhome, where he continued his lamentations all thenight. But, because every one who asks receives, andwho seeks ﬁnds, and to him who knocks it shall beopened, and, as the Psalmist says, “The Lord hathheard the desire of the poor,” at midnight, when everything was buried in sleep, and the poor man alone waskept awake by poverty and sorrow for his loss, on asudden, wonderful to be related, the oxen which he wasseeking came to the door, as if by Divine interposition,having returned safe from the hands of the robbers,through the wild country and the darkness of night, totheir owner’s house.

He went to the church of St.Felix, and took his oxen along with him. He joyfullytold every one who met him on his way thither, and alsothose who were at the church, the beneﬁts which he hadreceived from the holy confessor; and, inasmuch as bylamenting for his loss, or from joy at their recovery, he haddone no small injury to his eyes, he offered up apetitionto St. Felix, and got them cured; so that he returnedhome beneﬁted in more ways than one, and full of joy.At this time they desired to erect a more noble building in honour of the saint; and for this purpose wishedto remove two small cottages of disagreeable exterior,which stood in the way, and presented a most unsightlyappearance in the vicinity of the church. With thisend in view, Bishop Paulinus requested their owners topay respect to the holy Saint Felix, and suffer theirprivate houses to be removed, in order to beautify andimprove the church. The owners, however, perverselyrejected his request, and said they would part withtheir lives rather than their property. The bishop despaired of being able to overcome their obstinacy, butthis was speedily brought about by the Divine inter—position: for one night, when all were asleep, a conﬂagration suddenly arose from one of those same cells,and began to spread to the neighbouring houses, apparently gaining fresh strength every moment, and likelyto consume all the houses far and near.

Immediately the ﬂames subsided, and thissmall fragment of wood effected what so many men,with abundance of water, had not been able to accomplish. Such, indeed, was its power, that the usualnature of things was changed; and ﬁre, which usuallyconsumes every thing, was itself consumed by the woodof our Lord’s passion. When the conﬂagration wasover, the citizens came in the morning to see whathavoc had been committed during the night, and expected to ﬁnd that they were great losers: but theyfound that nothing had been bumt, except what deserved to be burnt. Of the two houses before-mentioned, which even themselves wished to destroy, onewas utterly consumed by the ﬂames. The owner wasput to shame by the thing; for be perceived that hehad lost his house all the same, without meriting anyobligation from the holy father; and immediately afterwards began to pull down with his own hands allthat was still standing of both the houses, so that thewhole space round the church might be cleared, and berendered worthy the merits of the saint. When all therubbish was removed, the Bishop Paulinus perseveredin rebuilding the church, and accomplished the task inthree years, adding pictures, and every other proper</p>

Some faults were, attheir suggestion, carefully amended, and thus everyscruple being utterly removed, I have taken care tocommit to writing what I clearly ascertained to be thetruth, and to bring it into your presence also, my brethren, in order that by the judgment of your authority,what I have written might be either corrected, if false,or certiﬁed to be true. Whilst, with God’s assistance,Iwas so engaged, and my book was read during twodays by the elders and teachers of your congregation,and was accurately weighed and examined in all itsparts, there was nothing at all found which required tobe altered, but every thing which I had written was bycommon consent pronounced worthy to be read withoutany hesitation, and to be handed over to be copied bysuch as by zeal for religion should be disposed to do so.But you also, in my presence, added many other factsof no less importance than what I had written, con—cerning the life and virtues of that blessed man, andwhich well deserved to be mentioned, if I had notthought it unmeet to insert new matter into a work,which, after due deliberation, I considered to be perfeet.Furthermore, I have thought right to admonish yourgracious company, that, as I have not delayed to renderprompt obedience to your commands, so you also maynot be slow to confer on me the reward of your intercession; but when you read this book, and in piousrecollection of that holy father lift up your souls withardour in aspiration for the heavenly kingdom, do notforget to entreat the Divine clemency in favour of my</p>

Hujusnamque boni dulcedine accensus, vir Domini Cuthbertusab ineunte adolescentia jugo monachicæ institutioniscollum subdidit; et ubi opportunitas juvit, arrepta etiamconversatione anachoretica, non pauco tempore solitariussedere atque ob suavitatem Divinæ contemplationis abhumanis tacere delectabatur alloquiis. Sed ut hæc inmajore ætate posset, superna illum gratia ad viam veritatis paullatim a primis jam pueritiae incitaverat annis ;siquidem usque ad octavum ætatis annum, qui postïnfantiam pueritiæ primus est, solis parvulorum ludis etlasciviæ mentem dare noverat, ita ut illud beati Samuelistunc de ipso posset testimonium dici, [1 Reg. iii. 7.]Porro Cuthbertus necdum sciebat Dominum, nequerevelatusfuerat ei sermo Domini.

But that he shouldbe able to do this in his advanced years, was the effectof God’s grace inciting him gradually to the way oftruth from his early childhood ; for even to the eighthyear of his life, which is the ﬁrst year of boyhood succeeding to infancy, he gave his mind to such plays andenjoyments alone as boys delight in, so that it might hetestiﬁed of him as it was of Samuel, “ Moreover Cuthbert knew not yet the Lord, neither had the voice ofthe Lord been revealed to him.” Such was the panegyric of his boyhood, who in more ripened age wasdestined perfectly to know the Lord, and opening theears of his mind to imbibe the voice of God. He tookdelight, as we have stated, in mirth and clamour; and,as was natural at his age, rejoiced to attach himself tothe company of other boys, and to share in their sports:and because he was agile by nature, and of a quickmind, he often prevailed over them in their boyish contests, and frequently, when the rest were tired, he alonewould hold out, and look triumphantly around to see ifany remained to contend with him for victory. For injumping, running, wrestling, or any other bodily exercise, he boasted that he could surpass all those whowere of the same age, and even some that were olderthan himself. For when he was a child, he knew as achild, he thought as a child; but afterwards, when hebecame a man, he most abundantly laid aside all thosechildish things.
