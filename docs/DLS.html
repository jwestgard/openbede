    <p>cause they received the Holy Spirit in that place, andSaint Mary died there. The place of our Lord’s holysupper is shown within; and a marble pillar stands inthe middle of the church, to which our Lord was tiedwhen he was scourged. The ﬁgure of the church issaid to have been something like this :—(The drawing is wanting in the Manuscripte.)Here is also shown, on the outside of the city, therock on which the ﬁrst martyr, Stephen, was stoned: butin the middle of J erusalem, where the dead man came tolife when our Lord’s cross was placed above him, standsa lofty pillar, which at the summer solstice does notthrow a shadow, wherefore it is thought that the centreof the earth is in this place; and it has been said inhistory, “ God, ages ago, hath wrought our salvation inthe middle of the earth.” According to which opinionVictorinus, Bishop of the Church of Poitiers, writing ofGolgotha, hath these words:“ In the earth’s centre, ’tis believed the placeBy J ews called Golgotha, we seek to trace.”CHAP.

IV.—0F THE NAPKIN FROM OUR LORD’BHEAD, AND or ANOTHER AND LARGER TOWELMADE BY THE VIRGIN MARY.II E napkin from our Lord’s headwas stolen after his resurrectionby a most good and Christian: J cw, who kept it till his death, andleft no end of riches. On his' dcath-bed he asked his sons whichof them would have the napkin,and which his other treasures.Thefelder chose the worldly money; the younger tookthe napkin. In process of time the wealth of theformer diminished until he was reduced to poverty; butthe riches of the younger increased with his faith, andthe napkin continued for ﬁve generations in the possession of the faithful. After this, it fell into unholyhands, and increased their wealth as much as it haddone in the case of the Jews, and for a very long time;until, after long quarrels, the Christian Jews sayingthey were the heirs of Christ, and the unbelieving onessaying that they ought to inherit what had belonged totheir fathers, Majuvias, king of the Saracens, who livedin our own times, was made umpire. He immediatelykindled a large ﬁre, and prayed Christ, who had deignedto wear this on his head for our salvation, to decide thequestion. The napkin was thrown into the ﬁre, butrose out of it again most rapidly, and ﬂoated along, asif in sport, through the air ; and at last, whilst bothparties were looking on, it gently lowered itself into the</p>

There is another rather larger inthe same church, made by Saint Mary, having ﬁguresof the twelve Apostles, and of our Lord himself. Oneside of it is red, and the other green.CHAP. V.—OF THE PLACES NEAR JERUSALEM, ANDTHE CHURCH IN THE VALLEY OF JEHOSHAPHAT,WHERE SAINT MARY WAS BURIED.THE country round Jerusalem is rocky and mountainous. The ground on the north, from that city toArimathæa, is, at intervals, rough and stony. Thereare open valleys covered with thorns extending all theway to the region of Tamnitis; but from xElia to Caesarea of Palestine, though some narrow and craggy placesare found for a short distance, yet the principal part ofthe way is a level plain, interspersed with olive-yards:the distance is seventy—ﬁve miles. The length of theLand of Promise, from Dan over to Beersheba, is ahundred and sixty miles, and from J oppa to Bethlehemforty-six miles. Near Jerusalem and the wall of thetemple is Gehennon, which is the valley of Jehosha—phat, extending from north to south, and through itﬂows the brook Cedron, when it is swelled by a fall ofrain. This valley, forming a small level plain, is wellwatered and woody, and full of delightful things: formerly there was in it a place dedicated to Baal. Herewas the tower of King Jehoshaphat, containing histomb; on the right side of it was a separate chamber,cut out of the rock of Mount Olivet, containing twohollow sepulchres, one of the old Simeon, the other of</p>

In the same valleyis the round church of Saint Mary, divided by slabs ofstone; in the upper part are four altars ; on the easternside below there is another, and to the right of it anempty tomb, in which Saint Mary is said to havereposed for a time; but who removed her, or when thistook place, no one can say. On entering this chamber,you see on the right-hand side a stone inserted in thewall, on which Christ knelt when he prayed on thenight in which he was betrayed; and the marks of hisknees are still seen in the stone,as if it had been as softas wax.CHAP. VI. -—0F MOUNT omvm‘, AND THE CHURCHFOUNDED UPON IT, WHERE OUR LORD ASCENDEDTO HEAVEN.THE Mount of Olives is ﬁve miles distant from Jerusalem, and is equal in height to Mount Sion, but exceedsit in breadth and length; it bears few trees except vinesand olive-trees, and is ﬁ‘uitful in wheat and barley ; forthe nature of that soil is not calculated for hearingthings of large or heavy growth, but grass and ﬂowers.On the very top of it, where our Lord ascehded intoheaven, is a large round church, having about it threevaulted porches. For the inner house could not bevaulted and covered, because of the passage of ourLord’s body ; but it has an altar on the east side,covered with a narrow roof. In the midst of it are tobe seen the last prints of our Lord’s feet, and the skyappears open above where he ascended; and though theearth is daily carried away by believers, yet still it remains as before, and retains the same impression of thefeet. Near this lies a brazen wheel, as high as a man’sneck, having an entrance towards the west, With a greatlamp hanging above it on a pulley, and burning night</p>

In the western part of the same church areeight windows; and eight lamps, hanging opposite tothem by cords,-cast their light through the glass as faras Jerusalem; this light is said to strike the hearts ofthe beholders With a sort of joy and humility. Everyyear, on the day of the Ascension, when mass is ended,a strong blast of wind is said to come down, and to castto the ground all that are in the church. The whole ofthat night lanterns are kept burning there, so that themountain and the country beneath appear not onlylighted up, but actually to be on ﬁre. Of this church,also, I have thought proper to add below a resemblance.(The drawing is wanting.)The monument of Lazarus is indicated by a churchbuilt on the same spot, and a large monastery in a ﬁeldat Bethany, in the midst of a large grove of olives.Bethany is ﬁfteen furlongs from Jerusalem. There isalso a third church on the same mountain, towards thenorthern side of Bethany, where our Lord spoke to hisdisciples, before he suffered, concerning the day ofjudgment.CHAP.

The whole of this caveis covered within with beautiful marble, over the placewhere especially our Lord is said to have been born.It has above it the great church of St. Mary. Near thewall is a hollow stone, which received back from thewall the ﬁrst water in which our Lord’s body waswashed, when it was thrown away, and still retains thesame. If by any accident or service it has been emptied,it nevertheless becomes again, in a short time, as full asbefore. To the north of Bethlehem, in a neighbouringvalley, is the tomb of David, in the middle of thechurch, covered with a low stone, and with a lumpplaced above it. In a church which stands in an adjoining valley, to the south, is the tomb of Jerome.Moreover, on the eastern side, in the tower of Ader,that is, of the Flock, at the distance of a thousand pacesfrom the city, is a church, containing monuments of thethree shepherds who were present at our Lord’s birth.I have stated these facts on the authority of BishopArculph. But Ezra writes in plain terms, that Davidwas buried in Jerusalem, in the king’s way, whichleads from Elia to Cedron; that Bethlehem is to theeast of it, and to the west is the tomb of Rachel, havingher name inscribed upon it even to this day.CHAP.

The bill Mamre is a thousand pacesfrom the monuments, and is full of grass and ﬂowers,having a ﬂat plain on the top. In the northern part ofit is Abraham’s oak, a stump about twice the height ofa man, enclosed in a church. Passing through Hebrontowards the north, one sees to the left a mountain of nogreat size, covered with ﬁr-trees, at a distance of threethousand paces from Hebron. Fir—wood is carried fromthis place to Jerusalem on camels ; for carriages andwaggons are seldom seen throughout the whole ofJudaea.CHAP. IX.— OF mmcuo, AND THE HOLY PLACESm THOSE PARTS.J ERICHO lies to the east of Elia, and is distant fromit nineteen thousand paces. It has been three timeslevelled to the ground ; and the house of Rahab, inreward for her faith, is the only one which remains; forits walls are still standing, though without a roof. Theplace where the city stood now contains corn-ﬁelds andvineyards. Between this and the J ordan, which isabout ﬁve or six miles distant, are large groves of palmtrees, with small plains interspersed, and inhabitants ofthe race of the Cauaanites. The twelve stones, whichJ oshua ordered to be taken out of the J ordan, lie in thechurch of Galgalis, against the wall on each side.Each of them is so heavy that two men could hardlylift it: one of them has been by some accident brokenin two, but the pieces have been again united by meansof iron. Near Jericho is a fountain of plentiful water,</p>

    <p>good to drink and ﬁt for irrigation, though it formerlywas very ill adapted for fertilizing the ground, and veryoffensive to the taste; but it was puriﬁed by Elisha theProphet, who threw a vessel of salt into it. Around liesa plain, seventy furlongs in length and twenty broad, inwhich are gardens of extraordinary beauty, with variouskinds of palm-trees, and swarms of bees of surpassingexcellence. Opobalsam, also, is here produced, whichbears this name from the following circumstance :—Thecountrymen cut narrow channels in the bark with sharpstones, and the sap gradually oozing out through theseopenings, forms itself into pearl-like drops. Now theGreek word ope signiﬁes a cavern, or opening. Theysay the cypress and myrobalanum are there produced.The water of the fountains, like other things, is theremost excellent; in summer it is cold, in winter lukewarm: the air is so mild that they wear linen garmentsin the winter. The city itself is built in the plain,which it overlooks, and it is bare of animals; for thesoil is sickly and hungry, and therefore abandoned byinhabitants. From the territory of the city Scythopolisto the region of Sodom and Asphaltus, extends an opencountry. Over-against this is a mountain above theriver Jordan, extending from the city J ulias to Zoar,which borders on Arabia Petræa, where also there is amountain called the Iron Mountain. Between thesetwo mountains is a plain, which the ancients called theGreat Plain: its Hebrew name is Aulon. The lengthof it is two hundred and thirty furlongs; in breadth itis a hundred and twenty: it begins at the village ofGennabara, and ends at the lake Asphaltus. TheJordan divides it in the middle, and the banks are rendered most luxuriant by the deposits of the river; sothat the produce of the trees is every where most abundant along the margin of the stream, but elsewhere it israther scanty; for the soil, except where the river runs,is dry and barren.E e</p>

    <p>CHAP. X.——-0F THE RIVER JORDAN AND THE SEAOF GALILEE, OTHERWISE CALLED THE SEA 0!?TIBERIAS.THE sources of the J ordan itselfare commonly thoughtto be in the province of Phænicia, at the foot of MountLibanus, where Panium, or Caesarea Philippi, is situated.This town, Panium, so called as descriptive of the cavefrom which the river J ordan ﬂows, is said to have beenbuilt up and adorned by King Agrippa with wonderfulmagniﬁcence. In the country of Trachonitis, there isa fountain after the likeness of a wheel, from which ithas received the name of Phiale, ﬁﬁeen miles distantfrom Cæsarea, full of sweet water, and having this peculiarity, that it never overﬂows, and yet never can bediminished. Philip, the tetrarch of this district, threwstraw into this fountain, which was again cast up bythe river in Panium. It is therefore evident that thesources of the Jordan are in Phiale; but that, afterpassing underground, it resumes its course in Panium,and entering the lake, ﬂows right through its shallows,and from thence proceeds without any break, for thespace of ﬁfteen miles, to a city named Julias, and thencedivides the lake of Gennesar half-way on its wholecourse. After this it winds about for a long distance,and as it enters the Asphaltian, i. e. the Dead Sea, itpresents a remarkable mass of waters. The colour of itis white, like milk; and for this reason it is distinguished by a long track in the Dead Sea. Now, theSea of Gennesar, otherwise called the Sea of Galilee, issurrounded by large woods, and is a hundred and fortystadia in length. Its water is sweet and ﬁt to drink;for it receives no mud or other coarse substance fromany marshy pools, but is surrounded on all sides by asandy shore, and has in its neighbourhood many pleasant towns. 0n the east lie Julias and Hippo ; on theE e 2</p>

But itappears to those who look at it from the top of MountOlivet, 'that the collision of the waves causes salt of avery strong kind to be thrown up, which, when driedin the sun, is collected, and is of considerable service tomany of the neighbouring nations. Salt is said to beproduced in a different manner from this in a certainmountain of Sicily, where large blocks of the strongestand most useful salt are hewn out of the earth: thisis called rock-salt. The name of the Dead Sea isderived from this circumstance—that it does not sustain any kind of living thing; for there are neitherﬁsh in its depths, nor water-fowl swimming uponits surface; and bulls and camels ﬂoat upon it. Indeed, if by accident the river Jordan, when swollenby storms, carries down any ﬁsh into it, they immediately die, and their dead bodies are seen ﬂoating onthe languid waters. They say that a lighted candlewill ﬂoat without being upset, and that when the lightis put out, it sinks; but that it is difﬁcult for any thing</p>

    <p>else. to be made stop at the bottom; and that everyliving thing, however different, and with whatever violence thrown in, instantly rises again. Indeed, it isrecorded that Vespasian ordered some persons whocould not swim to be thrown in with their hands tiedbehind their backs, and all of them rose and ﬂoated onthe top. The water is bitter and unfertilizing, of adarker colour than other water, and tastes as if it hadbeen burnt. It is certain that lumps of bitumen witha black liquor are seen swimming in the water, and thenatives go out in boats and collect them. They saythat the bitumen sticks together most ﬁrmly, and cannot be divided by any instrument of steel, but dissolvesin urine, or in the blood of a woman. It is of use tofasten ships, and is applied medicinally to the humanbody. The whole region still bears marks of the judgment inﬂicted upon it. Apples of a most beautifulappearance are produced there, which make the mouthsof the beholders water, but when gathered, they rot andmoulder to ashes, and send forth smoke, as if still actedon by ﬁre. In summer an excessive vapour ﬂoats overthe whole plain; by which cause, and the great droughtco-operating together, the air becomes corrupted, andthe inhabitants are afﬂicted with dreadful distempers.CHAP. XII.—0F THE PLACE WHERE OUR LORDWAS BAPTIZED.N the place where our Lord wasbaptized, stands a wooden cross ashigh as a manfs neck, and sometimes covered by the water. Fromit to the further, that is, the east-‘em bank, is a sling’s cast; and on; ' .' the nearer bank is a large monas' tery of St. J ohn the Baptist, stand</p>

Inthe further part of the river is a quadrangular church,supported on four stone arches, covered with burnttiles, where our Lord’s clothes are said to have beenkept whilst he was baptized. Men do not enter thischui'ch, but come together round it from all quarters:from the place where the Jordan leaves the Sea ofGalilee, to where it enters the Dead Sea, is a journey ofeight days.CHAP. XIII.—0F THE Locus'rs, THE WILD HONEY,AND THE FOUNTAIN OF ". JOHN THE BAPTIST.IT was the smallest species of locusts which formedthe food of J ohn the Baptist, as is clear from the practice of the present day. Their bodies are short andslender, about the size of a ﬁnger, and are easily captured on the plants. When boiled in oil, they form aplain and humble kind of food. In the same desert aretrees, having broad round leaves of a white colour andsweet taste, naturally weak, and easily bruised by thehands for eating. This is said to be what is meant bywood or wild honey. In the same place is shown St.J ohn the Baptist’s fountain of the clearest water, havinga stone roof covered with mortar.CHAP.

    <p>CHAP. XV.—OF TIBERIAS, CAPERNAUM, NAZABETH, AND THE HOLY PLACES IN THOSE PARTS.THE place in which our Lord blessed the loaves andﬁshes on this side of the Sea of Galilee, to the north ofthe city of Tiberias, is a plain, grassy and level, which.has never been ploughed since those times, nor has everbeen built upon; but there is the same fountain therefrom which those persons drank. Those who go fromElia to Capernaum, pass through Tiberias, and fromthence along the Sea of Galilee to the place where theloaves were blessed, from which it is no great distanceto Capemaum on the borders of Zebulon and Naphtali.The town has no walls, and lies on a narrow piece ofground between a mountain and lake. On the seacoast towards the east it extends a long way, having themountain on the north, and lake on the south. Nazareth has no walls, but large houses, and two greatchurches. One of these is in the midst of the city,built on two arches, where formerly was a house, inwhich our Lord was nursed when an infant. Thischurch is built on two eminences, with arches connecting them, and has under it, between the eminences, aclear fountain, from which all the citizens draw waterin vessels with pulleys for the use of the church. Inthe other church was the house in which the angelcame to the blessed Mary.CHAP.

But when one has passed the narrow neckand mouth of the harbour, the sea, still following thelikeness of the human body, spreads itself far and/ *wide. On its right-hand side is a small port, in whichis the Pharos, a large tower, which is every nightlighted up with torches, lest sailors might mistake theirway in the dark and dash against the rocks, in theirattempt to ﬁnd the entrance, particularly as this ismuch impeded and disturbed by the waves dashing toand fro. The port, however, is always calm, and inmagnitude about thirty furlongs. Towards Egypt, asone enters the city, there is a large church on the right,in which reposes St. Mark the Evangelist. The bodyis buried in the eastern part of the church before thealtar, with a monument over it of squared marble.Along the Nile the Egyptians are in the habit of constructing numerous mounds, to prevent the irruption ofthe water, which, if the mounds were to be broken downby the neglect of the guardians, would not irrigate, butinundate and destroy the lands beneath.

    <p>ing to the line of sea, is about twelve thousand paces.Constantine was at ﬁrst disposed to build it in Cilicia,near the sea which separates Europe and Asia; but ona certain night all the iron tools were carried away, and,when men were sent to fetch them, they were found onthe European side; for there it was the will of Godthat it should be built. In this city is a church ofwonderful workmanship, called the church of SaintSophia, built up from its foundation of a circular shape,domed in, and surrounded by three walls. It is supported to a great height on columns and arches, andhas in its inmost part, on the north side, a large andbeautiful closet, wherein is a wooden chest with awooden lid, containing three pieces of our Lord’s cross,that is to say, the long timber cut in two, and thetransverse part of the same holy cross. These piecesare exhibited for the adoration of the people three timesonly in the year, namely, on the day of our Lord’ssupper, the day of the preparation, and on the HolySabbath. On the first of these, the chest, which is twocubits long and one broad, is set out on a golden altarwith the holy cross exposed to view: the Emperor ﬁrstapproaches, and after him all the different ranks of laymen, in order, kiss and worship it: on the followingday the Empress and all the married women and virginsdo the same ; but on the third day the bishops anddifferent orders of the clergy do it ; and then the chestis shut, and carried back to the closet before mentioned.As long as it remains open on the altar, a wonderfulodour spreads through the whole church. For an odoriferous liquor like oil ﬂows from the knots of the holywood, the least drop of which cures every complaintwhich a man may be aﬂicted with.Thus have I sought in these few words to traceThe form and site of every holy place.For this memorials of past times have brought,And from each writer new instruction sought.F f</p>

    <p>Grant, J esus, that in Heaven we aJl may rest,And be for ever with Thy presence blest!CHAP. XX.-RECAPITULATION.THUS much have I written concerning the holyplaces, following, to the best of my knowledge, thetruth of history, and in particular the dictation ofArculph, bishop of Gaul, which Adamnan, that priestso learned in Holy Scripture, hath set down in hisjagged style, and comprised in three books. For theabove-named bishop, from a desire to see the holyplaces, left his native country, and went to the Land ofPromise, where he stopped two months at Jerusalem,having an old monk, named Peter, for his guide andinterpreter. He then with great zeal visited every thingall round, which he had longed to see, and travelled toAlexandria, Damascus, Constantinople, and Sicily. Onhis way home, the vessel in which he sailed, aﬁer muchbeating about, was carried by contrary winds to ourisland, that is, to Britain; and Arculph, after certainhazards, came to the above-named venerable man, Adamnan, and explained to him his voyage, and what hehad seen. Adamnan was thus enabled to compose amost beautiful history thereof. From this book wehave gleaned a little, and having compared it with thebooks of the ancients, have sent it for your perusal,beseeching you, by all means, to relieve your worldlylabours, not by indolence or licentiousness, but by holyreading and earnest prayer.</p>
