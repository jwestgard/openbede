    <p>FI‘ER the interval of a year, Benedict croeeed the sea into Gaul,and no sooner asked than he obtained and carried back with him.. _. some masons to build him a churchl" 7 in the Roman style, which he hadalways admired. So much zealdid he show from his love to SaintPeter, in whose honour he was building it, that withina year from the time of laying the foundation, youmight have seen the roof on and the solemnity of themass celebrated therein. When the work was drawingto completion, he sent messengers to Gaul to fetchmakers of glass, (more properly artiﬁcers,) who were atthis time unknown in Britain, that they might glazethe windows of his church, with the cloisters and diningrooms. This was done, and they came, and not onlyﬁnished the work required, but taught the Englishnation their handicraft, which was well adapted for en—closing the lanterns of the church, and for the vesselsrequired for various uses. All other things necessaryfor the service of the church and the altar, the sacredvessels, and the vestments, because they could not beprocured in England, he took especial care to buy andbring home from foreign parts. ,. OME decorations and munimentsthere were which could not be pro_ cured even in Gaul, and these the, .3 pious founder determined to fetchx, [A , from Rome , for which purpose,SA ,voyage to Rome, and returnedloaded with more abundant spiritual merchandise thanbefore. In the ﬁrst place, he brought back a largequantity of books of all kinds ; secondly, a great num</p>

Quartum, Benedictus non vile munus attulit,epistolam privilegii a venerabili papa Agathone cumlicentia, consensu, desiderio, et hortatu ngridi regis acceptam, qua. monasterium, quod fecit, ab omni prorsusextrinseca irruptione tutum perpetuo redderetur acliberum. Quintum, picturas imaginum sanctarum,quas ad omandum ecclesiam beati Petri Apostoli, quamconstruxerat, detulit; imaginem, videlicet, beatæ DeiGenetricis semperque virginis Mariæ, simul et duodecimApostolorum, quibus mediam ejusdem ecclesiæ testudinem, ducto a pariete ad parietem tabulato, præcingeret ; imagines evangelicæ historiæ, quibus australemecclesiæ parietem decoraret; imagines visionum Apocalypsis beati Johannis, quibus septentrionalem æqueparietem ornaret, quatenus intrantes ecclesiam omnes,etiam literarum ignari, quaquaversum intenderent, velsemper amabilem Christi sanctorumque ejus, quamvisin imagine, contemplarentur aspectum; vel Dominicæincarnationis gratiam vigilantiore mente recolerent; velextremi discrimen examinis quasi coram oculis habentes,districtius se ipsi examinare meminissent.</p>
    <p>ber of relics of Christ’s Apostles and martyrs, all likelyto bring a blessing on many an English church; thirdly,he introduced the Roman mode of chanting, singing,and ministering in the church, by obtaining permissionfrom Pope Agatho to take back with him John, thearchchanter of the church of St. Peter, and abbot of themonastery of St. Martin, to teach the English. ThisJ ohn, when he arrived in England, not only communicated instruction by teaching personally, but left hehind him numerous writings, which are still preservedin the library of the same monastery. In the fourthplace, Benedict brought with him a thing by no meansto be despised, namely, a letter of privilege from PopeAgatha, which he had procured, not only With theconsent, but by the request and exhortation, of Kingngrid, and by which the monastery was renderedsafe and secure for ever from foreign invasion. Fifthly,he brought with him pictures of sacred representations,to adorn the church of St. Peter, which he had built;namely, a likeness of the Virgin Mary and of thetwelve Apostles, with which he intended to adorn thecentral nave, on boarding placed from one wall to theother; also some ﬁgures from ecclesiastical history forthe south wall, and others from the Revelation of St.J ohn for the north wall; so that every one who enteredthe church,.even if they could not read, wherever theyturned their eyes, might have before them the amiablecountenance of Christ and his saints, though it werebut in a picture, and with watchful minds might revolve on the beneﬁts of our Lord’s incarnation, andhaving before their eyes the perils of the last judgment,might examine their hearts the more strictly on thataccount.</p>

Nec ab re videaturcuiquam duos unum monasterium simul habuisse abbates. Fecit hoc frequens illius pro monasterii utilitateprofectio, creber trans oceanum egressus incertusqueregressus.

    <p>Thus King ngrid, delighted by the virtues andzealous piety of the venerable Benedict, augmented theterritory Which he had given, on Which to build thismonastery, by a further grant of land of forty hides; onwhich, at the end of a year, Benedict, by the same Kingngrid’s concurrence, and, indeed, command, built themonastery of the Apostle St. Paul, with this condition,that the same concord and unity should exist for everbetween the two ; so that, for instance, as the bodycannot be separated from the head, nor the head forgetthe body by which it lives, in the same manner noman. should ever try to divide these two monasteries,yvhich had been united under the names of the ﬁrst ofthe Apostles. Ceolfrid, whom Benedict made abbot,had been his most zealous assistant from the ﬁrst foundation of the former monastery, and had gone with himat the proper time to Rome, for the sake of acquiringinstruction, and offering up his prayers. At which timealso he chose priest Easterwine to be the abbot of St.Peter’s monastery, that with the help of this fellow-soldier he might sustain a burden otherwise too heavy forhim. And let no one think it unbecoming that onemonastery should have two abbots at once. His fre_quent travelling for the beneﬁt of the monastery, andabsence in foreign parts, was the cause; and historyinforms us, that, on a pressing occasion, the blessed St.Peter also ordained two pontiﬁ's under him to rule theChurch at Rome; and Abbot Benedict the Great, himself, as Pope St. Gregory writes of him, appointedtwelve abbots over his followers, as he judged expedient, without any harm done to Christian charity;nay, rather to the increase thereof.</p>
    <p>Suscepit igitur memoratus vir curam monasterii regendi, nono, ex qua fundamentum est, anno. Permansit in eo usque ad obitum suum annis quatuor, virnobilis, sed insigne nobilitatis non ad jactantiæ materiem, ut quidam, despectumque aliorum, sed ad majorem,ut Dei servum decet, animi nobilitatem convertens. Patruelis quippe erat abbatis sui Benedicti, sed amborumtanta mentis ingenuitas, talis mundanæ ingenuitatis fuitpro nihilo contemtus, ut neque iste monasterium ingressus, aliquem sibi præ ceteris ob intuitum consanguinitatis aut nobilitatis honorem quærendum, nequeille putaret offerendum; sed æquali cum fratribus lanceboni propositi juvenis gloriabatur se regularem peromnia servare disciplinam. Et quidem cum fuissetminister ngridi regis, relictis semel negotiis secularibus, depositis armis, assumta militia spirituali tantum,mansit humilis, fratrumque simillimus aliorum, ut ventilare cum eis et triturare, oves vitulasque mulgere, inpistrino, in horto, in coquina, in cunctis monasteriioperibus, jucundus et obediens gauderet exerceri.

    <p>HIS mun therefore undertook the' government of the monastery in), the ninth year after its foundation," and continued it till his death fouryears after. He was a man ofnoble birth ; but he did not makethat, like some mon, a cause Ofboasting and dcspising others, buta motive for exercising nobility of mind also, as becomes a servant of the Lord. He was the cousin of hisown abbot Benedict; and yet such was the singlenessof mind in both, such their contempt for human grandeur, that the one, on entering the monastery, did notexpect any notice of honour or relationship to be takenof him more than of others, and Benedict himself neverthought of offering any; but the young man, faringlike the rest, took pleasure in undergoing the usualcourse of monastic discipline in every respect. Andindeed, though he had been an attendant on Kingngrid, and had abandoued his temporal vocation andarms, devoting himself to spiritual warfare, he remainedso humble and like the other brethren, that he tookpleasure in threshing and winnowing, milking the ewesand cows, and employed himself in the bakehouse, thegarden, the kitchen, and in all the other labours of themonastery with readiness and submission. When heattained to the name and dignity of abbot, be retainedthe same spirit; saying to all, according to the adviceof a certain wise man, “ They have made thee a ruler ;be not exalted, but be amongst them like one of them,gentle, affable, and kind to all.” Whenever occasionrequired, he punished oﬁ'enders by regular discipline;but was rather careful, out of his natural habits of love,to warn them not to offend and bring a cloud of disquietude over his cheerful countenance. Oftentimel,when he went forth on the business of the monastery,if he found the brethren working, he would join them</p>

    <p>and work with them, by taking the plough-handle, orhandling the smith’s hammer, or using the winnowingmachine, or any thing of like nature. For he was ayoung man of great strength, and pleasant tone ofvoice, of a. kind and bountiful disposition, and fair tolook on. He ate of the same food as the other brethren, and in the same apartment: he slept in the samecommon room as he did before he was abbot ; so thateven after he was taken ill, and foresaw clear signs ofhis approaching death, he still remained two days in thecommon dormitory of the brethren. He passed the ﬁvedays immediame before his death in a private apartment, from which he came out one day, and sitting inthe open air, sent for all the brethren, and, as his kindfeelings prompted him, gave to each of them the kiss ofpeace, whilst they all shed tears of sorrow for the lossof this their father and their guide. He died on theseventh of March, in the night, as the brethren wereleaving off the matin hymn. He was twenty—four yearsold when he entered the monastery; he lived theretwelve years, during seven of which he was in priest’sorders, the others he passed in the dignity of abbot;and so, having thrown off his ﬂeshly and perishablebody, he entered the heavenly kingdom.Now that we have had this foretaste of the life of thevenerable Easterwine, let us resume the thread of thenarrative. When Benedict had made this man abbotof St. Peter’s, and Ceolfrid abbot of St. Paul’s, he notlong after made his ﬁfth voyage from Britain to Rome,and returned (as usual) with an immense number ofproper ecclesiastical relics. There were many sacredbooks and pictures of the saints, as numerous as before.He also brought with him pictures out of our Lord’shistory, which he hung round the chapel of Our Ladyin the larger monastery; and others to adorn St. Paul’schurch and monastery, ably describing the connexion</p>

Sed aderatet solamen, quia. in loco Easterwini virum æque reverendissimum ac mitissimum de monasterio eodem, Sibfridum videlicet diaconum, electione fratrum suorumsimul et coabbatis ejus Ceolfridi, mox substitutum cognovit; virum scientia quidem Scripturarum sufficienterinstructum, moribus optimis ornatum, mira abstinentiævirtute præditum, sed ad custodiam virtutum animicorporis infirmitate non minime depressum, ad conservandam cordis innocentiam nocivo et irremediabili pulmonum vitio laborantem.Nec multo post etiam Benedictus ipse morbo ccepitingruente fatigari. Ut enim tantam religionis instantiam etiam patientiæ virtus adjuncta probaret, Divinautrumque pietas temporali ægritudine postravit in lectum; ut post aegritudinem morte devictam perpetumsupernæ pacis et lucis quiete refoveret.

    <p>of the Old and New Testament ; as, for instance, Isaacbearing the wood for his own sacriﬁce, and Christ carrying the cross on which he was about to suffer, wereplaced side by side. Again, the serpent raised up byMoses in the desert was illustrated by the Son of Manexalted on the cross. Among other things, he broughttwo cloaks, all of silk, and of incomparable workmanship, for which he received an estate of three hides onthe south bank of the river Were, near its mouth, fromKing Alfrid, for he found on his return that ngridhad been murdered during his absence.UT, amid this prosperity, he found\‘ afﬂictions also awaiting his return.The venerable Easterwine, whom’ he had made abbot when be de; parted, and many of the brethren"' committed to his care, had died ofa general pestilence. But for thisloss he found some consolation inthe good and reverend deacon, Sigfrid, whom the brethren and his co-abbot Ceolfrid had chosen to be hissuccessor. He was a man Well skilled in the knowledge of Holy Scripture, of most excellent manners, ofwonderful continence, and one in whom the virtues ofthe mind were in no small degree depressed by bodilyinﬁrmity, and the innocency of whose heart was tempered with a baneful and incurable aﬂ'ection of thelungs.Not long after, Benedict himself was seized by adisease. For, that the virtue of patience might be atrial of their religious zeal, the Divine Love laid both ofthem on the bed of temporal sickness, that when theyhad conquered their sorrows by death, He might cherishthem for ever in heavenly peace and quietude. ForSigfrid also, as I have mentioned, died wasted by a longillness: and Benedict died of a palsy, which grew uponB b</p>

Sed et hoc sedulus eisdem solebat iteraremandatum, ne quis in electione abbatis, generis prosapiam, et non magis vivendi docendique probitatem,putaret esse quærendum. ‘ Et vere,’ inquit, ‘ dico vobis,quia in comparatione duorum malorum, tolerabilius mihimulto est totum hunc locum, in quo monasterium feci,si sic judicaverit Deus, in solitudinem sempiternamredigi, quam ut frater meus carnalis, quem novimusviam veritatis non ingredi, in eo regendo post me abbatis nomine succedat.

He urged the brethren, whenthey came to see him, to observe the rule which he hadgiven them. “ For,” said he, “ you cannot suppose thatit was my own untaught heart which dictated this ruleto you. I learnt it from seventeen monasteries, whichI saw during my travels, and most approved of, and Icopied these institutions thence for your beneﬁt.” Thelarge and noble library, which he had brought fromRome, and which was necessary for the ediﬁcation ofhis church, he commanded to be kept entire, and neitherby neglect to be injured or dispersed. But on one pointhe was most solicitous, in choosing an abbot, lest highbirth, and not rather probity of life and doctrine, shouldbe attended to. “And I tell you of a truth,” said he,“ in the choice of two evils, it would be much moretolerable for me, if God so pleased, that this place,wherein I have built the monastery, should for everbecome a desert, than that my carnal brother, who, aswe know, walks not in the way of truth, should becomeabbot, and succeed me in its government. Wherefore,my brethren, beware, and never choose an abbot onaccount of his birth, nor from any foreign place; butseek out, according to the rule of Abbot Benedict theGreat, and the decrees of our order, with common consent, from amongst your own company, whoever invirtue of life and wisdom of doctrine may be found ﬁttest for this ofﬁce; and whomsoever you shall, by thisunanimous inquiry of Christian charity, prefer andchoose, let him be made abbot with the customaryblessings, in presence of the bishop.

    <p>after the ﬂesh beget children of the ﬂesh, must necessarily seek ﬂeshly and earthly heirs to their ﬂeshly andearthly inheritance; but those who by the spiritual seedof the Word procreate spiritual sons to God, must oflike necessity be spiritual in every thing which they do.Among their spiritual children, they think him thegreatest who is possessed of the most abundant graceof the Spirit, in the same way as earthly parents consider their eldest as the principal one of their children,and prefer him to the others in dividing out their inheritance.”Nor must I omit to mention that the venerable AbbotBenedict, to lessen the wearisomeness of the night,which from his illness he often passed without sleeping,would frequently call a reader, and cause him to readaloud, as an example for himself, the history of thepatience of Job, or some other extract from Scripture,by which his pains might be alleviated, and his depressed soul be raised to heavenly things. And becausehe could not get up to pray, nor without difﬁculty liftup his voice to the usual extent of daily psalmody, theprudent man, in his zeal for religion, at every hour ofdaily or nightly prayer would call to him some of thebrethren, and making them sing psalms in two companies, would himself sing with them, and thus make upby their voices for the deﬁciency of his own.N ow both the abbots saw that they were near death,and unﬁt longer to rule the monastery, from increasingweakness, which, though tending no doubt to the perfection of Christian purity, was so great, that, whenthey expressed a desire to see one another before theydied, and Sigfrid was brought in a litter into the roomwhere Benedict was lying on his bed, though they were</p>

    <p>placed by the attendants with their heads on the samepillow, they had not the power of their own strength tokiss one another, but were assisted even in this act offraternal love. After taking counsel with Sigfrid andthe other brethren, Benedict sent for Ceolfrid, abbot ofSt. Paul’s, dear to him not by relationship of the ﬂesh,but by the ties of Christian virtue, and with the consentand approbation of all, made him abbot of both monasteries; thinking it expedient in every respect to preserve peace, unity, and concord between the two, if theyshould have one father and ruler for ever, after theexample of the kingdom of Israel, which always remained invincible and inviolate by foreign nations aslong as it was ruled by one and the same governor ofits own race; but when for its former sins it was torninto opposing factions, it fell by degrees, and, thusshorn of its ancient integrity, perished. He remindedthem also of that evangelical maxim, ever worthy to beremembered,—“ A kingdom divided against itself shallbe laid waste.”Two months after this, God’s chosen servant, thevenerable Abbot Sigfrid, having passed through theﬁre and water of temporal tribulation, was carried tothe resting—place of everlasting repose: he entered themansion of the heavenly kingdom, rendering up wholeofferings of praise to the Lord which his righteous lipshad vowed ; and after another space of four months,Benedict, who so nobly vanquished sin and wroughtthe deeds of virtue, yielded to the weakness of the ﬂesh,and came to his end. Night came on chilled by thewinter’s blasts, but a day of etemal felicity succeeded, of</p>

    <p>serenity and of splendour. The brethren met together atthe church, and passed the night without sleep in praying and singing, consoling their sorrow for their father’sdeparture by one continued outpouring of praise.Others clung to the chamber in which the sick man,strong in mind, awaited his departure ﬁ'om death andhis entry into eternal life. A portion of Scripture fromthe Gospels, appointed to be read every evening, wasrecited by a priest during the whole night, to relievetheir sorrow. The sacrament of our Lord’s ﬂesh andblood was given him as a viaticum at the moment ofhis departure; and thus his holy spirit, chastened andtried by the lengthened gallings of the lash, operatingfor his own good, abandoned the earthy tenement ofthe ﬂesh, and escaped in freedom to the glory of everlasting happiness. That his departure was most triumphant, and neither impeded nor delayed by uncleanspirits, the psalm which was chanted for him is a proof.For the brethren coming together to the church at thebeginning of the night, sang through the Psalter inorder, until they came to the 82nd, which begins,“ God, who shall be like unto thee ?" The subject ofthe text is this; that the enemies of the Christian name,whether carnal or spiritual, are always endeavouring todestroy and disperse the church of Christ, and everyindividual soul among the faithful; but that, on theother hand, they themselves shall be confounded androuted, and shall perish for ever, unnerved before thepower of the Lord, to whom there is no one equal, forHe alone is Most Highest over the whole earth. Wherefore it was a manifest token of Divine interposition,that such a song should be sung at the moment of hisdeath, against whom, with God’s aid, no enemy couldprevail. In the sixteenth year after he built the monastery, the holy confessor found rest in the Lord, on the14th day of January, in the church of St. Peter; andthus, as he had loved that holy Apostle in his life, and</p>

    <p>obtained from him admission into the heavenly kingdom,so also after death he rested hard by his relics, and hisaltar, even in the body. He ruled the monastery, as Ihave stated, sixteen years: the ﬁrst eight alone, withoutany assistant abbot; the last eight in conjunction withEasterwine, Sigfrid, and Ceolfrid, who enjoyed with himthe title of abbot, and assisted him in his duties. Theﬁrst of these was his colleague four years; the second,three; the third, one.HE third of these, Ceolﬁ'id, was a,' man of great perseverance, of acute, gag intellect,bold in action,experienced179% in judgment, and zealous in reli' ' gion. He ﬁrst of all, as we havementioned, with the advice and«. assistance of Benedict, founded,completed, and ruled the monastery of St. Paul’s seven years; and, aﬁerwards, ablygoverned, during twenty-eight years, both these monasteries ; or, to speak more correctly, the single monasteryof St. Peter and St. Paul, in its two separate localities;and, whatever works of merit his predecessor hadbegun, he, with no less zeal, took pains to ﬁnish. For,among other arrangements which he found it necessaryto make, during his long government of the monastery,he built several oratories; increased the number ofvessels of the church and altar, and the vestments ofevery kind; and the library of both monasteries, whichAbbot Benedict had so actively begun, under his equallyzealous care became doubled in extent. For he addedthree Pandects of a new translation to that of the oldtranslation which he had brought from Rome; one ofthem, returning to Rome in his old age, he took withhim as a giﬁ; the other two he left to the two monasteries. Moreover, for a beautiful volume of the Geographers which Benedict had bought at Rome, he</p>

    <p>received from king Alfrid, who was well skilled inHoly Scripture, in exchange, a grant of land of eighthides, near the river Fresca, for the monastery of St.Paul’s. Benedict had arranged this purchase with thesame King Alfrid, before his death, but died before hecould complete it. Instead of this land, Ceolfrid, inthe reign of Osred, paid an additional price, and received&amp; territory of twenty hides, in the village called by thenatives Sambuce, and situated much nearer to themonastery. In the time of Pope Sefgius, of blessedmemory, some monks were sent to Rome, who procuredfrom him a privilege for the protection of their monastery, similar to that which Pope Agatha had given toBenedict. This was brought back to Britain, and,being exhibited before a synod, was conﬁrmed by thesignatures of the bishops who were present, and their Amuniﬁcent King Alfrid, just as the former privilegewas conﬁrmed publicly by the king and bishops of thetime. Zealous for the welfare of St. Peter’s monastery,at that time under the government of the reverend andreligious servant of Christ, Witmer, whose acquaintancewith every kind of learning, both sacred and profane,was equally extensive, he made a gift of it for ever of aportion of land of ten hides, which he had receivedfrom King Alfrid, in the village called Daldun.UT Ceolfrid having now practiseda long course of regular discipline,which the prudent father Benedicthad laid down for himself and hisbrethren on the authority of theelders; and having shown the most‘ incomparable skill both in prayingand chanting, in which he dailyexercised himself, together with the most wonderfulenergy in punishing the wicked, and modesty in consoling the weak; having also observed such abstinence</p>

Having, therefore,deliberated long within himself, he judged it expedient,having ﬁrst impressed on the brethren the observanceof the rules which St. Benedict had given them, andthereby to choose for themselves a more efﬁcient abbotout of their own number, to depart, himself, to Rome,where he had been in his youth with the holy Benedict ; that not only he might for a time be free from allworldly cares before his death, and so have leisure andquiet for reﬂection, but that they also, having chosen ayounger abbot, might naturally, in consequence thereof,observe more accurately the rules of monastic disci..ll' ID cqlx'ﬁs: him on their knees and with many: tears, but their solicitations werey' to no purpose. Such was his' eagemess to depart, that on the‘x * third day after he had disclosedhis design to the brethren, he setout upon his journey. For hefeared, what actually came to pass, that he might diebefore he reached Rome; and he was also anxious thatneither his friends nor the nobility, who all honouredhim, should delay his departure, or give him moneywhich he would not have time to repay ; for with himit was an invariable rule, if any one made him a present, to show equal grace by returning it, either at onceor within a suitable space of time. Early in the moming, therefore, of Wednesday, the 4th of May, the masswas sung in the church of the Mother of God, the immaculate Virgin Mary, and in the church of the Apostle,"!

    <p>Peter; and those who were present communicatingwith him, he prepared for his departure. All of themassembled in St. Peter’s church; and-when he hadlighted the frankincense, and addressed a prayer at thealtar, he gave his blessing to all, standing on the stepsand holding the censer in his hand. Amid the prayersof the Litany, the cry of sorrow resounded from all asthey went out of the church: they entered the oratoryof St. Laurence the martyr, which was in the dormitoryof the brethren over-against them. Whilst giving themhis last farewell, he admonished them to preserve lovetowards one another, and to correct, according to theGospel rule, those who did amiss: he forgave all ofthem whatever wrong they might have done him; andentreated them all to pray for him, and to be reconciledto him, if he had ever reprimanded them too harshly.They went down to the shore, and there, amid tears andlamentations, he gave them the kiss of peace, as theyknelt upon their knees; and when he had oﬂ'ered up aprayer he went on board the vessel with his companions. The deacons of the Church went on board withhim, carrying lighted tapers and a golden cruciﬁx.Having crossed the river, he kissed the cross, mountedhis horse, and departed, leaving in both his monasteriesabout six hundred brethren.When he was gone, the brethren returned to thechurch, and with much weeping and prayer commendedthemselves and theirs to the protection of the Lord.After a short interval, having ended the nine o’clockpsalm, they again assembled, and deliberated what wasto be done. At length they resolved, with prayer,hymns, and fasting, to seek of the Lord a new abbotas soon as possible. This resolution they communicated to their brethren of St. Paul’s, by some of thatmonastery who were present, and also by some of theirown people. They immediately gave their consent, andboth monasteries showing the same spirit, they all togec c</p>

    <p>ther lifted up their hearts and voices to the Lord. Atlength, on the third day, which was Easter Sunday, anassembly was held, consisting of all the brethren of St.Peter’s and several of the elder monks from the monastery of St. Paul’s. The greatest concord prevailed, andthe same sentiments were expressed by both. Theyelected for their new abbot, Huetbert, who from hisboyhood had not only been bred up in the regular discipline of the monastery, but had acquired much experience in the various duties of writing, chanting, reading, and teaching. He had been at Rome in the timeof Pope Sergius, of blessed memory, and had therelearnt and copied every thing which he thought usefulor worthy to be brought away. He had also beentwelve years in priest’s orders. He was now madeabbot; and immediately went with some of the brethren to Ceolfrid, who was waiting for a ship in whichto cross the ocean. They told him what they had done,for which he gave thanks to God, in approbation oftheir choice, and received from his successor a letter ofrecommendation to Pope Gregory, of which I have preserved the few passages which follow.“ To our most beloved lord in the Lord of lords,and thrice blessed Pope Gregory, Huetbert, his most.humble servant, abbot of the monastery of the holiestof the Apostles, St. Peter, in Saxony, Health for everin the Lord! I do not cease to give thanks to the dispensation of Divine wisdom, as do also all the holybrethren, who in these parts are seeking with me tobear the pleasant yoke of Christ, that they may ﬁndrest to their souls, that God has condescended to appoint so glorious a vessel of election tonile the Churchin these our times; and by means of the light of truthand faith with which you are full, to scatter the beamsof his love on all your inferiors also.

    <p>Christ, the grey hairs of our venerable and belovedfather Abbot Ceolfrid, the supporter and defender ofour spiritual liberty and peace in this monastic retirement; and, in the ﬁrst place, we give thanks to theholy and undivided Trinity, for that, although he hathcaused us much sorrow, lamentation, and tears, by hisdeparture, he hath nevertheless arrived at the enjoymentof that rest which he long desired; whilst he was in hisold age devoutly returning to that threshold of the holyApostles, which he exultingly boasted, that when ayouth he had visited, seen, and worshipped. Aftermore than forty years of care and toil, during hisgovernment of the monasteries, by his wonderful loveof virtue, as if recently incited to conversation with theheavenly life, though worn out with extreme old age,and already almost at the gates of death, he a secondtime undertakes to travel in the cause of Christ, thatthe thorns of his former secular anxieties may be consumed by the ﬁre of zeal blazing forth from thatspiritual furnace. We next entreat your fatherly love,that, though we have not merited to do this, you willcarefully fulﬁl towards him the last oﬂices; knowingfor certain, that though you may possess his body, yetboth we and you shall have in his devout spirit, whetherin the body or out of the body, a mighty intercessorand protector over our own last moments, at the throneof grace.” And so on through the rest of the letter.When Huetbert had returned to the monastery,Bishop Acca was sent for to conﬁrm the election withhis blessing. Afterwards, by his youthful zeal andwisdom, he gained many privileges for the monastery ;and, amongst others, one which gave great delight toall, he took up the bones of Abbot Easterwine, whichlay in the entrance porch of St. Peter’s, and also thebones of his old preceptor, Abbot Sigfrid, which hadbeen buried outside the Sacrarium towards the south,and placing both together in one chest, but separated</p>

He did this on Sigfrid’s birthday, the 23rd of August ; and on the same day DivineProvidence so ordered that Christ’s venerable servantWitmer, whom we have already mentioned, departedthis life, and was buried in the same place as the aforesaid abbots, whose life he had imitated.«- UT Christ’s servant Ceolfrid, ashas been said, died on his way toof old age and weakness. For hereached the Lingones about ninethe next day' m the church of thethree twin martyrs, much to the sorrow, not only of theEnglish who were in his train, to the number of eighty,but also of the neighbouring inhabitants, who were dissolved in tears at the loss of the reverend father. Forit was almost impossible to avoid weeping to see part ofhis company continuing their journey without the holyfather, whilst others, abandoning their ﬁrst intentions,returned home to relate his death and burial ; andothers, again, lingered in sorrow at the tomb of the deceased among strangers speaking an unknown tongue.EOLFRID was seventy—four yearsold when he died: forty-seven yearshe had been in priest’s orders,during tbirty-ﬁve of which he hadbeen abbot; or, to speak more. correctly, forty-three,——for, from": the time when Benedict began tobuild his monastery in honour ofthe holiest of the Apostles, Ceolfrid had been his onlycompanion, coadjutor, and teacher of the monastic rules.</p>

I.—0F JERUSALEM.HE city of Jerusalem is almostcircular in its form, and the com' pass of its walls is by no meansinconsiderable, and formerly in~ 3Q eluded Mount Sion, which is close, ;'&amp;x' by, towards the south, and looks5- -;; like the citadel of the town. Thegreater part of the city is lowerthan the mountain,fand lies on the plain summit of oneof the lower hills in the neighbourhood. Aﬁer ourLord’s passion it was destroyed by the Emperor Titus;but was restored and enlarged by Allius HadrianusCæsar, from whom it received the name of Elia. Thisis the reason why the place where our Lord suﬂ'eredand was buried is now within the walls, whereas it was' at that time without. In the circumference of its walls,which is extensive, there are eighty—four towers and sixgates. The ﬁrst is David’s gate, to the west of MountSion: the second is the gate of the Fuller’s Valley: the:i&amp;xxi(,.</p>

A meridie autem, aquilonale montisSion supercilium supereminet civitati, et ea pars murorum cum interpositis turribus nullas habere portascomprobatur, id est, a suprascripta David porta, usquead eam montis Sion frontem, quæ prærupta rupe orientalem respicit plagam.

    <p>third is St. Stephen’s gate: the fourth, Benjamin’s:the ﬁfth is the Postem or little gate, through which wego down by steps to the Valley of Jehoshaphat: thesixth gate is called Thecuitis. The most celebrated ofthese are the three gates of egress; the ﬁrst towardsthe west, the second towards the north, and the thirdtowards the east. On the south the northern brow ofMount Sion appears above the city; and this part ofthe walls, with the interposing towers, is proved to havehad no gates ; namely, from David’s gate above-mentioned, to that front of Mount Sion which looks with arugged precipice towards the east. For the position of ~the city itself is this: it begins from the northern browof Mount Sion, and falls with a gentle slope towardsthe walls on the north-east, where it is lower, so thatthe rain which falls runs in streams through the easterngates, and carries with it all the ﬁlth of the streets intothe brook Cedron, in the Valley of J ehoshaphat.CHAP. IL—OF THE HOLY PLACES IN IT.WHEN you have entered the city on the northernside, ﬁrst of the holy places, as regards the order ofthe streets, you must turn out of the way to see thechurch of Constantine, which is called the Martyrdom.It was built in the most magniﬁcent and princely styleby the Emperor Constantine, to commemorate the ﬁnding of our Lord’s cross in this place by his motherHelena. To the west of this is seen the church ofGolgotha, where too may be seen the rock which formerly bore the very cross that was fastened to ourLord’s body; but which now bears a very large silvercross, and a great wheel of brass hangs from above withlamps. Under the place of our Lord’s cross, a vault is</p>
    <p>excisa in petra crypta est, in qua super altare prodefunctis honoratis sacrificium solet offerri, positisinterim in platea corporibus. Hujus quoque ad occasum ecclesiæ Anastasia, hoc est, resurrectionis Dominicæ rotunda ecclesia, tribus cincta parietibus, duodecim columnis sustentatur, inter parietes singuloslatum habens spatium viæ, quæ tria. altaria. in tribuslocis parietis medii continet, hoc est, australi, aquilonali,et occidentali. Hæc bis quaternas portas, id est, introitus per tres e regione parietes habet, e quibus quatuor ad Vulturnum, et quatuor ad Eurum spectant.Hujus in medio monumentum Domini rotundum petraexcisum est, cujus culmen intrinsecus stans homomanu contingere potest, ab oriente habens introitum,cui lapis ille magnus appositus est, quod intrinsecusferramentorum vestigia usque in præsens ostendunt.Nam extrinsecus usque ad culminis summitatem totummarmore tectum est; summum verO- culmen auroornatum, auream magnam gestat crucem. In hujusergo monumenti aquilonali parte sepulchrum Dominiin eadem petra excisum, longitudinis septem pedum,trium mensura palmarum pavimento altius eminet, introitum habens a latere meridiano: ubi die noctuqueduodecim lampades ardent, quatuor intra sepulchrum,octo supra in margine dextro.

    <p>hewn out of the rock, in which sacriﬁce is offered onan altar for honourable persons deceased, their bodiesremaining meanwhile in the street. To the westwardof this is the Anastasis, that is, the round church of ourSaviour’s resurrection, encompassed with three walls,and supported by twelve columns. Between each ofthe walls is a broad space, containing three altars atthree different points of the middle wall, on the north,the south, and the west. It has eight doors or entrances through the three opposite walls; four whereoffront to the north-east, and four to the south-east. Inthe midst of it is the round tomb of our Lord cut outof the rock, the top of which a man standing within cantouch; the entrance is on the east; against it is laidthat great stone, which to this day bears the marks ofthe iron tools within, but on the outside it is all coveredwith marble to the very top of the roof, which isadorned with gold, and bears &amp; large golden cross. Inthe north part of the monument is the tomb of ourLord, hewn out of the same rock, seven feet in length,and three palms above the ﬂoor; the entrance being onthe south side, where twelve lamps bum day and night,four within the sepulchre, and eight above on the righthand side. The stone that was laid a't the entrance tothe monument is now cleft in two; the lesser part of itstands as a square altar before the door of the monument; the greater part makes another square altar inthe east part of the same church, and appears under thelinen cloths. The colour of the said monument andsepulchre appears to be white and red. Attached tothis church on the right side is the square church ofthe blessed Mother of our Lord. In the street whichunites the Martyrdom and the Golgotha is a seat, inwhich is the cup of our Lord concealed in a casket. Itis touched and kissed through a hole in the covering.It is made of silver, has two handles, one on each side,and holds a French 'quart. In it also is the sponge</p>

Singula quæ dixi,ut manifestius agnosceres, etiam præ oculis depingerecuravi.(Deest ﬁyura in MSS.)Hæc quidem omnia quæ commemoravimus sanctaloca, extra montem Sion posita cernuntur, quo se adaquilonem deficiens loci tumor porrexit. In inferiorivero parte urbis, ubi templum in vicinia muri ab orientelocatum, ipsique urbi, transitum pervio ponte mediante,fuerat conjunctum, nunc Saraceni quadratam domumsubrectis tabulis et magnis trabibus super quasdam ruinarum reliquias vili opere construentes, oratione frequentant, quæ tria millia hominum capere videtur.

    <p>which was used to minister drink to our Lord. Butwhere Abraham built an altar whereon to sacriﬁce hisson, there is a large wooden table, on which the peoplelay alms for the poor. The soldier’s lance also is keptinserted in a wooden cross, in the portico of the Martyrdom, and its shaft, which has been broken in twopieces, is an object of veneration to the whole city. Allthese particulars, which I have here mentioned, I haveendeavoured to render more intelligible by the following,picture.(The drawing is wanting in the Manmcripta.)Now all these holy places, which we have mentioned, are situated beyond Mount Sion, to which theelevated ground extends as it falls away towards thenorth. But in the lower part of the city, where therewas a temple built in the neighbourth of the wall, onthe eastern side, and joined to the city itself by a bridgewhich formed a thoroughfare between, the Saracenshave now erected there a square building, with uprightplanks and large beams placed, in the roughest manner,over some ruins of the walls, and they frequent theplace for prayer. There is room for three thousandpersons. There are a few cisterns there to supplywater. In the neighbourhood of the temple is the poolof Bethsaida, marked by its two basins, one of which isgenerally ﬁlled by the rains of winter, the other is dis—coloured with red water. On that front of Mount Sionwhich has a rugged precipice facing the east, the fountain of Siloa bursts forth between the walls at thebottom of the hill. According as it receives an increase of water from time to time, it ﬂows towards thesouth; therefore its waters are not sweet, but the dayand hour of its springing up are uncertain, and itrushes with much noise amid the hollows in the groundand the hard rocks. On the level summit of MountSion are numerous cells of monks surrounding a largechurch, built there, as they say, by the Apostles, beD d</p>
