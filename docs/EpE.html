    <p>CONCERNING ECCLESIASTIC DISCIPLINE.EDE, the ServantofChrist,to his most Beloved theRight Reverend Bishop Egbert, Health! I rememberhearing you say last year,when I spent a few days inyour monastery for purposes of study, that you' would wish, this year also,. when you should arrive atthe same place, to have me near you to converse With,for the same purposes of study, common to us both.If this wish could, by God’s favour, be accomplished,there would be no need of my communicating with youat present by letter, since I could then more freely inprivate conversation say to you, face to face, whateverI wished or deemed expedient. But since the state ofmy health has,.as you know, become such as to preventthis from coming to pass, I have yet, with brotherlydevotion, in return for your affection, sent you byletter what I was not able to communicate in person.And I pray you by the Lord, not to consider the pointof this letter to be fraught with arrogance and vanity,but as the true submission of humility and pious affection.I therefore exhort your Holiness, my beloved Bishopin Christ, to conﬁrm both by holy life and by holyteaching, the sacred dignity which God, the Author ofdignities and Giver of spiritual gifts, hath bestowed</p>
    <p>tione et doctrina confirmare memineris. Neutra enimhæc virtus sine altera rite potest impleri; si aut is, quibene vivit, docendi officium negligit, aut recte docensantistes rectam exercere operationem contemnit. Quiautem utrumque veraciter agit, profecto talis servusadventum Domini sui gratulabundus exspectat, sperans se citius auditurum, “ Euge serve bone et fidelis,quia super pauca fuisti ﬁdelis, supra multa te constitutam; intra. in gaudium Domini tui." Si quis vero,quod absit, gradu episcopatus accepto, nec seipsum amalis actibus bene vivendo, nec subditam sibi plebemcastigando, vel admonendo, corrigere curat; quid huic,veniente Domino, hora qua non sperat, eventurum sit,evangelica manifeste sententia declarat, qua dicitur adinutilem servum, “ Ejicite in tenebras exteriores, ibierit ﬂetus et stridor dentium."Ante omnia sane tuæ sanct'æ paternitati suadeo,ut ab otiosis te confabulationibus, obtrectationibus,ceterisque linguæ indomitae contagiis, pontificali dig:nitate coerceas; divinis autem eloquiis ac meditationibus Scripturarum linguam simul et mentem oc-'cupes, et maxime legendis beati Pauli apostoli Epistolisad Timotheum et Titum, sed et verbis sanctissimi papæGregorii, quibus de vita simul et vitiis rectorum, sivein libro Regulæ Pastoralis, seu in homeliis evangeliimultum curiose disseruit, ut sit sermo tuus sempersapientiæ sale conditus, eminentior vulgari locutione,ac divino auditui dignior elucescat. Sicut enim indecens est, si vasa altaris sacrosancta vulgaribusunquam usibus ac vilibus prophanentur ochiis, itaperversum omni modo ac miserum est, si is, qui adconsecranda in altari dominica sacramenta ordinatusest, nunc quidem eisdem conficiendis sacramentisDomino famulatums assistat, nunc egressus ecclesiamipso ore eisdemque manibus, quibus paulo ante sacra</p>
    <p>upon you. For neither of these is complete withoutthe other: if the bishop whose life is pure, omits theduty of teaching, or the good teacher neglects to practise what is right. But he who faithfully does both, is Preachingthat servant who shall with joy await the coming of the $1533.18Lord, hoping soon to hear “ Well done, good and Mmam.faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few 23'things, I will make thee ruler over many things ; enterthou into the joy of thy Lord.” But if any one, whichGod forbid, shall receive the rank of bishop, and shalltake no pains, either by a righteous life, to save himselffrom evil, or his people by punishing and admonishingthem; what shall happen to him when the Lord comesat an hour that he knew not of, is declared plainly inthat Gospel sentence, addressed to the unproﬁtableservant, “ Cast him into outer darkness: where shallbe weeping and gnashing of teet .”In particular, I advise your fatherly sanctity toabstain in your pontiﬁca] dignity from idle confabuIations and revilings, and other pollutions of the unrestrained tongue: and to occupy your tongue and mindin divine preachings and meditations on Scripture, andparticularly in reading the epistles of the Apostle St.Paul to Timothy and Titus, and in the words of theblessed Pope Gregory, wherein he hath spoken much St.Gregory’Sand curiously of the life and the faults of rulers, in his £3330»book of the Pastoral Rule, and in his homilies on the '""ded'Gospel, that your language should always be seasonedwith the salt of wisdom, elevated above the commondiction, and more worthy of the divine ear. For, as itis unbecoming that the holy vessels of the altar shouldever be prohned by vulgar use and vile services, so isit in every respect untoward and lamentable, that hewho is ordained to consecrate the Lord’s sacramentsupon the altar, should at one moment stand ministeringto the Lord of such ceremonies, and then, leaving thechurch, with the same mouth and the same hands,</p>

Quod cum omnibus Dei famulis sibimet itaprospicere utillimum sit, quanto magis illi gradui, quinon suimet tantummodo curam agere, sed etiam ergacommissam sibi ecclesiam, necesse habet studium salutis impendere? juxta illum qui dixit, “ præter ea quæextrinsecus sunt instantia mea quotidiana, sollicitudoomnium ecclesiarum. Quis inﬁrmatur, et ego non inﬁrmor? quis scandalizatur, et ego non uror?" Quodnon ita loquor, quasi te aliter facere sciam. sed quia dequibusdam episcopis fama vulgatum est, quod ipsi itaChristo serviant, ut nullos secum alicujus religionis autcontinentiae viros habeant; sed potius illos qui risui, jocisfabulis , comessationibus et ebrietatibus, ceterisque vitæremissioris illecebris subigantur, et qui magis quotidieventrem dapibus, quam mentem sacrificiis cælestibuspascant.

If this be expedient to all God’s children, howmuch more so to men of that rank, who have not onlythe care of their own salvation, but also that of thechurch committed to their charge? as we ﬁnd it written, 2Cor.xi. as.“ besides those things that are Without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. Who ismade weak, and I am not made weak? Who is scandalized, and I burn not ?" I do not say this from any suspi,cion that you act otherwise; but because it is noisedabroad concerning some bishops that they have no menof religion or continende near them; but rather such asindulge in laughter and jests, revellings, and drunkenness and other temptations of an idle life, and whorather feed their bodies with carnal food than theirminds on the heavenly sacriﬁce. Such, if you shouldmeet with any, I would wish you to correct by your holyauthority, and advise them to have such witnesses oftheir conversation, both by night and day, as maysufﬁce to beneﬁt the people, by actions worthy of theLord, and by suitable exhortations, and so further thespiritual labours of the bishops themselves. For readthe Acts of the Apostles, and you will see by the narrative of Saint Luke, What companions Paul and Bar- pammanabas had with them, and what works they themselves mmm"wrought, wherever they went. For as soon as theyentered a city or a synagogue, they sought to preachthe word of God, and to disseminate it on every side.This, I would wish you also, beloved friend, to makeI</p>
    <p>secratus es, ut Verbum evangelizas virtute mägna, præbente tibi auxilium ipso rege virtutum Domino nostroJesu Christo. Quod ita rite perﬁcies si ubicunqueperveneris, mox collectis ad te ejusdem loci incolis,verbum illis exhortationis exhibueris, simul et exemplum vivendi una cum omnibus, qui tecum venerint,quasi cælestis militiæ ductor ostenderis.Et quia latiora sunt spatia locorum, quæ ad gubernacula tuæ diæcesis pertinent, quam ut solus peromnia discurrere, et in singulis viculis atque agellisverbum Dei prædicare, etiam anni totius emenso curriculo, suﬂicias: necessarium satis est, ut plures tibisacri operis adjutores adsciscas, presbyteros videlicetordinando, atque instituendo doctores, qui in singulisviculis prædicando Dei verbo et consecrandis mysteriiscoelestibus, ac maxime peragendis sacri baptismatisofﬁciis, ubi opportunitas ingruerit, insistant. In quavidelicet prædicatione populis exhibenda, hoc præceteris omni instantia procurandum arbitror, ut fidemcatholicam, quæ apostolorum äymbolo continetur, etDominicam orationem, quam sancti Evangelii nosscriptura edocet, omnium, qui ad tuum regimen pertinent, memoriæ radicitus inﬁgere cures. Et quidemomnes, qui Latinam linguam lectionis usu didicerunt,etiam hæc optime didicisse certissimum est; sed idiotas, hoc est, eos qui propriæ tantum linguæ notitiamhabent, hæc ipsa sua lingua dicere ac sedulo decantarefacito. Quod non solum de laicis, id est, in populariadhuc vita constitutis, verum etiam de clericis sivemonachis, qui Latinæ sunt linguæ expertes, fieri oportet. Sic enim ﬁt, ut ccetus omnis ﬁdelium quomodoﬁdelis esse, qua se ﬁrmitate credendi contra immundorum spirituum certamina munire atque armare debeat, discat; sic, ut chorus omnis Deo supplicantium</p>
    <p>your aim; for to this duty you were elected, to this youwere consecrated, that with great virtues you shouldpreach the Gospel, by the aid of Him who is the Princeof all virtue, Jesus Christ our Lord. You will accomplish this, if, wherever you arrive, you gather togetherthe inhabitants, lay before them the words of exhortation, and in the character of leader of the celestialwarfare, set an example of life together with all whomay have come with you.And because your diocese is too extensive for youalone to go through it, and preach the word of God inevery village and hamlet, even if you give a whole .year to it; it is necessary that you appoint others toassist you in the holy work, by ordaining priests and lïarochi-lnominating teachers who may be zealous in preachingcem'the word of God in every village, and celebrating theholy mysteries, and especially by performing the sacredrites of baptism wherever opportuninty may offer. Andin Setting forth such preaching to the people, I considerit above every other thing important, that you shouldendeavour to implant deeply in the memory of all menthe Catholic faith which is contained in the Apostles'Creed, and the Lord’s Prayer as it is taught us in theHoly Gospel. And, indeed, there is no doubt that those The Beliefand thewho have studied the Latin language will be found to Lord’sPrayertobeknow these well; but the vulgar, that is, those who ittgﬂi‘mknow only their own language, must be made to say wnauethem and repeat them over and over again in their owntongue. This must be done not only in the case oflaymen, who are still in the life of the world, but withthe clergy or monks, who are without a knowledge ofthe Latin tongue. For thus every congregation of thefaithﬁﬂ will learn in what manner they ought to showtheir faith, and with what steadfastness of belief theyshould arm and fortify themselves against the assaultsof unclean spirits: and thus every choir of those whopray to God will learn what they ought especially toI 2</p>
    <p>quid maxime a divina clementia quæri oporteat, agnoscat. PrOpter quod et ipse multis sæpe sacerdotibus idiotis hæc utraque, et symbolum videlicet, etDominicam orationem, in linguam Anglorum translatam obtuli. Nam et sanctus antistes Ambrosiushoc de ﬁde loquens admonet, ut verba symboli matutinis semper horis fideles quique decantent, et hoc sequasi antidoto spirituali contra diaboli venena, quæillis interdiu ve] noctu astu maligno objicere posset,præmuniant. Orationem vero Dominican]: sæpius decantari ipsa etiam nos consuetudo sedulæ deprecationisac genuum ﬂexionis docuit.Quod si hæc, ut suggerimus in regendis pascendisque Christi ovibus, tua pastoralis auctoritasperfecerit, dici non potest quantum tibi supernæ mercedis apud Pastorem pastorum in futuro praeparaveris.Quanto enim rariora hujus sacratissimi operis in episcopis nostrae gentis exempla reperis, tanto altiora singularis meriti præmia recipies; utpote qui populumDei per crebram symboli vel orationis sacræ decantationem ad intellectum, amorem, spem, ﬁdem et inquisitionem eorundem, quæ decantantur, coelestiumdonorum, paterna pietate ac sollicitudine provocatumaccenderis. Sicut e contrario, si commissum tibi aDomino negotium minus diligenter compleveris, proretentione talenti cum servo nequam et pigro partemes recepturus in futuro; maxime si temporalia ab illiscommoda requirere atque accipere præsumseris, quibusnulla coelestis beneficii dona rependere probaveris.Cum enim Dominus mittens ad evangelizandum discipulos dixisset, “ Euntes autem prædicate, dicentesquia appropinquat regnum cælorum ;" paulo post subjunxit dicens, “ Gratis accepistis, gratis date; nolitepossidere aurum, neque argentum." Si ergo illosgratis Evangelium prædicare jussit. neque aurum velargentum, vel aliquid pecuniæ temporalis ab eis, qui</p>
    <p>ask for from the Divine Mercy. Wherefore, also, Ihave myself often given English translations of boththese, namely, the Creed and the Lord’s Prayer, to uneducated priests. For the holy prelate, Ambrose, also,speaking of faith, gives this admonition, that all thefaithful should repeat the words of the Creed everymorning early, and so fortify themselves as by a spiritual antidote against the poison which the malignantcunning of the Devil may either by night or by daycast out against them. But the Lord’s Prayer should Frequentrepetition ofbe very frequently repeated, as even we have learnt bythe Lord“:the habit of earnest deprecation and bending of knees. mine.If your pastoral authority can accomplish these oursuggestions in ruling and feeding Christ’s sheep, whoshall declare what a heavenly reward you will preparefor yourself before Him who is the Shepherd of shepherds? The feWer examples you ﬁnd of this holy workamong the bishops of our nation, the higher will beyour reward for your individual merit, inasmuch as youwill by this paternal care and affection stir up and excite God’s people through the frequent repetition of theCreed, or holy prayer, to seek after intelligence, love,hope, and all those same heavenly gifts which are enumerated in their prayers. As, too, on the contrary, ifyou negligently discharge the duty committed to you bythe Lord, you will take part hereafter with the wickedand idle servant for thus withholding your talent; espe—cially if you have presumed to ask and receive temporalgifts from those on whom you have not thought ﬁtto bestow heavenly gifts in recompense. For when theLord sent his disciples to preach the Gospel, and saidto them, a As ye go, preach, saying : The kingdom of ft.7hf;ttgew,heaven is at hand,” he added a little further on, ' ' ' '“ Freely ye have received, freely give; provide neither ,gold nor silver.” If, therefore, he ordered them topreach the Gospel freely, and did not permit them toreceive gold or silver, or any temporal payment of</p>

    <p>money from those to whom they preached, whathazard, I would ask, must hang over those who do thecontrary?Consider what a heavy crime is committed by thosewho diligently seek earthly lucre from their hearers,and take no pains for their everlasting salvation, bypreaching, exhorting, or rebuking them. Weigh thismost anxiously and with the most careful attention,most beloved Prelate. For we have heard it reported,that there are many country-houses and hamlets of ournation situated on inaccessible mountains and thickforests, where, for many years, no bishop comes toperform any of the duties of holy ministry or Divinegrace, yet none of these is free from paying tribute tothe bishop; and yet not only is there no bishop amongthem to conﬁrm by the laying on of hands those whohave been baptized, but they have not even any teacherto instruct them in the truth of the faith, and in thedifference between good and evil. Thus some of ourbishops not only do not freely preach the Gospel andconﬁrm those who have been baptized, but do what isworse; for they receive money from their hearers contrary to God'l commands, and neglect the ministry ofthe word, which God ordained them to preach: whereasGod’s beloved high priest, Samuel, is recorded to haveacted very differently, in the judgment of all the people.“ Therefore,” says he, “ I have dwelt before you from Samuel'smy youth even to this day; behold, here I am; say of æmïgjd'eï,me befo‘re God, and before his Christ, whether I havetaken any one’s ox or ass; whether I have falsely accused any one, or oppressed any one, or taken a giftfrom the hand of any one; and I will hold it for noughtthis day, and will restore it to you. And they said,Thou hast not accused us falsely; neither hast thou oppressed us, nor taken any thing from the hand of anyman.” In reward for his innocence and justice he wasnumbered among the leaders and priests of God’s peo</p>

He spake untothem in the cloudy pillar."But, if we believe and confess, that any good iswrought on the faithful by the laying on of hands,whereby they receive the Holy Spirit; it follows, onthe contrary, that those who have not the laying on ofhands, must be deprived of this beneﬁt. On whom,then, does this privation reﬂect, if not on the bishopswho promise they will be their guardians, but eitherfrom neglect or inability perform none of the spiritualduties of a guardian. " Covetousness and nothing else,1s Againstcothe cause of this conduct. Against which the Apostle (in "mmmwhom Christ spake) argues, when he says, “ The lovelTim.vi-10of money is the root of all evil;" and again, “ Neither 1 Com. 10.shall the covetous inherit the kingdom of God." Forwhen a bishop, for the love of money, has nominallytaken under his guardianship a larger portion of thepeople than he can by any means visit and preach tothe whole year round, it is plain that he is only gathering danger and destruction for himself, as well as thosewhose false guardian he is.Thus far, most beloved Bishop, have I brieﬂy alluded to the calamity under which our country is suffering most severely, and I earnestly beseech you tostrive to rectify what you see done amiss.

    <p>statum nostræ gentis ecclesiasticum in melius, quamhactenus fuerat, instaurare curet. Quod non aliomagis, ut mihi videtur, potest ordine perfici, quamsi plures nostræ genti consecrentur antistites, exemplumque sequamini Legislatoris, qui quum solus jurgia.ac pondus Israeliticæ plebis sustinere non posset,elegit sibi divino adjutus consilio, et consecravit septuaginta seniores, quorum ope atque consilio impositum sibi onus ferre levius posset. Quis enini- nonvideat quanto sit melius tam enorme pondus ecclesiastici regiminis in plures, qui hoc dispertitum faciliusferant, dividi, quam unum sub fasce, quem portarenon possit, opprimi. Nam et sanctus papa Gregorius,quum de ﬁde nostræ gentis, quæ adhuc futura et conservanda *erat in Christo, ad beatissimum archiepiscopum Augustinum missis literis disputaret, duodecimin ea episcopos, postquam ad fidem venirent, ordinandos esse decrevit; in quibus Eboracensis antistes,accepto a sede apostolica pallio, metropolitanus essedeberet. Quem profecto numerum episcoporum velimmodo tua sancta paternitas, patrocinante præsidiopiissimi ac Deo dilecti regis præfati, solerter implerecontendat, quatenus, abundante numeramagistrorum,perfectius ecclesia Christi in his, quæ ad cultumsacræ religionis pertinent, instituatur. Et quidemnovimus, quia per incuriam regum præcedentium donationesque stultissimas factum est, ut non facile locusvacans, ubi sedes episcopalis nova ﬁeri debeat, inveniri valeat.Quapropter commodum duxerim, habito majoreconcilio et consensu pontificali simul et regali, edictoprospiciatur locus aliquis monasteriorum, ubi sedesepiscopalis ﬁat. Et ne forte abbas vel monachi buic</p>
    <p>biishment of our nation more complete than it hashitherto been. This cannot be better done, in myopinion, than by consecrating more bishops, and following the example of the lawgiver, who, when hefound himself unable alone to bear the strife and burden of the whole Israelitish people, moved by Divineinspiration, appointed and consecrated seventy Elders,whose aid and counsel might aid him in discharginghis heavy duties. Who is there that does not see howmuch better it would be to divide the weighty load ofecclesiastical rule among several, who can the moreeasily hear each his portion, than for the whole weightto be laid on one,—a burden greater than he can bear?For the holy Pope Gregory, in his letters to the blessed Pope am.Archbishop Augustine concerning the faith of our na- $333?"tion, which was still future, and required their exer- Efﬁﬁq‘éﬁetions to sustain it, ordered him to ordain twelve bishops 3:333?therein, as soon as they should have embraced thelee of ym"faith, and that the Bishop of York should receive thepallium from the Apostolic See, and become their metropolitan. Wherefore, holy F ather, I would wishthat you should, under the holy guidance of the abovenamed king, whom God loveth, endeavour, to the bestof your judgment, to make this number of bishopscomplete, in order that the number of ministers mayabound, and the church of Christ be the more ﬁJHy‘instructed in those things which pertain to the duties ofour holy religion. And, indeed, we know that, by thenegligence and foolish donations of preceding kings, itis not easy to ﬁnd a vacant place where a new episcopalsee may be erected.I should therefore consider it expedient, that a ge-. Ho recomneral council should be held, and the consent both ofïïldgoïä. . . . r [: kmgs and bishops be obtained, that, by a proclamation, älïwïgila place may be provided among the monasteries, where "an episcopal see may be created. And, lest any abbotor monks may endeavour to contravene or oppose this</p>

    <p>decree, licence should be given them to choose someone from among themselves to be ordained bishop, andto rule with episcopal authority, over the adjoiningcountry belonging to the same diocese, as well as themonastery itself: or, if no one can be found in thatmonastery fit to be ordained bishop, yet that it shalldepend upon their examination, according to the canonical-statutes, who shall be ordained bishop of thatdiocese. By following this suggestion, and with God’sassistance, you will ﬁnd no difﬁculty, I think, in fulﬁlling the appointment of the Apostolic See, and theBishop of the church of York will become the metropolitan. And, if it appear necessary that any additionof land or property should be made to such a monas—tery, that it may be the better able to undertake theepiscopal duties, there are, as we know well, manyplaces calling themselves monasteries, but exhibitingno sign whatever of a monastic system; some of whichI should much like to see transferred by synodical authority, that their present luxury, vanity, and intemperance in meat and drink might be exchanged forchastity, temperance, and piety, and that they may sohelp to sustain the episcopal see, which is to be created.And, seeing that there are many such large esta'Monuticin. . . . atitutlonabllshments, which, as Is commonly sald, are of use whichhad. . got into dlsnelther to God nor man, because they nelther observe use, to beregular monastic life, nor yet supply soldiers or atten— :35?“dants of the secular authorities to defend our shoresfrom barbarians; if any one were, according to the. necessities of the times, to erect an episcopal see insuch places, he may be shown to incur no blame ofprevarication, but rather to be doing an act of virtue.For how can it be accounted a misdeed, that the unjustdecrees of former kings should be set right by the correct judgment of princes better than they? or that thelying pen of unrighteous scribes should be destroyedand nulliﬁed by the discreet sentence of wiser priests,</p>

    <p>according to the example of ancient history, which, indescribing the times of the kings of Judah, from Davidand Solomon to Hezekiah, the last of them, shows thatsome of them were religious, but the greater numberreprobata; and that at one time the wicked censuredthe deeds of the good Who went before them, but atanother time the good, with the aid of God’s holyspirit, zealously corrected the hurtful deeds of theirwicked predecessors, as was their bounden duty, bymeans of the holy priests and prophets; according tothat saying of the holy Prophet Esaias, “ To loose thellciaiiialzbands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and ' .to let the oppressed go free." By which example itbehoves your holiness also, in conjunction with ourreligious king, to cancel the irreligious and unrighteousdeeds and writings of those who lived formerly, and toﬁx your eye on such things as may beneﬁt this province,either according to God, or according to the ﬂesh;lest, in these our times, either religion cease altogether (together with the love and fear of Him whoseeth into the heart), or the number of our secular sol-‘diers become lessened, and our borders be no longerdefended from the inroads of the barbarians. For,disgraceful though it be to say it, so many estates havebeen received under the name of monasteries by thosewho know nothing whatever of the monastic life, asyou yourselves know better than I, that the sons ofthe nobles, or of discharged soldiers, can ﬁnd no placewherein to receive their possessions ; and thus, havingnothing to do, and not marrying, though past the ageof puberty, they are held by no tie of continence ; andtherefore either go beyond the sea and abandon theircountry, which they ought to ﬁght for; or, with stillgreater wickedness and impudence, not being boundto chastity, become addicted to luxury and fornication,and do not abstain even from the very virgins who arededicated to God.</p>

    <p>But others, who are laymen, and have no experience Lay monuof the regular monastic life, nor any love for the same, gm?commit a still greater scandal:—for they give moneyto the kings, and under pretence of erecting monaste—ries they acquire possessions, wherein the more freelyto indulge their licentiousness; and procuring theseby a royal edict to be assigned over to them in inheritance, they get the deed by which these privileges areconﬁrmed, as if it were a matter worthy of God’s notice,authenticated by the signatures of the bishops, abbots,and secular authorities. And thus, having gained possession of farms and villages, they free themselves fromevery bond, both human and Divine, and in the character of superiors over monks, though they are butlaymen, they do nothing therein but gratify their desires. Nay, it is not monks that are there assembled,but all such as they can pick up, outcasts from other .monasteries for disobedience, or men whom they canallure away from other monasteries, or, in short, suchof their own followers as they can persuade to receivethe tonsure, and promise monastic obedience to themselves. With such ill-sorted societies do they ﬁll thecells which they have built, whilst they present a disgraceful spectacle, never before heard of : for at onetime they are occupied with their wives and the careof raising children, and at another time they rise fromtheir beds to occupy themselves with the internal concerns of the monastery. Furthermore they displaythe same folly in procuring land for their wives, as theysay, to erect convents, and these, equally foolish,though also laics, suffer themselves to become the superiors over Christ’s handmaidens. Well suited tothem is the proverb that wasps, though they can makecombs, yet store them with poison instead of honey.'Thus for about thirty years, ever since King Alfridwas removed from this life, our province has been involved in such folly and error, that there has not beenK</p>

    <p>a single præfect since that time, who has not furnishedhimself during his præfecture with a monastery of thiskind, and involved his wife also in the guilt of suchwicked trafﬁc; and thus this wicked custom has prevailed, and the king’s ministers and servants have bestirred themselves to do the like. So that numbers ofmen have been found, who Call themselves abbots andpræfects, or ministers or servants of the king, who, although as laymen, they may have learnt a little of themonastic life, not by experience, but by hearsay, yetare utterly without share of that character and profession which is required to teach it; and, indeed, suchmen, as you know, on a sudden submit to the tonsure,and of their own judgment, from laymen, become notmonks but abbots. But, inasmuch as they have noknowledge nor love of the above-named excellence,what can be more applicable to them than that malediction of the Gospel, “ If the blind lead the blind,both shall fall into the ditch ?" Such blindness might,in truth, some time or other, be put an end to, and restrained by regular discipline, and expelled by pontiﬁcal and synodical authority beyond the limits of theHoly Church, if the pontiﬂ‘s themselves were not found These evi!_ . encouragedto aid and abet such crimes ; for they not only do not forlwebvtake care to annul such unrighteous decrees by righteous $$$$$ones, but rather do all in their power to conﬁrm themby their own subscriptions, as we have "said before,prompted by the same love of money to conﬁrm thosewicked writings, as the purchasers themselves were tobuy such monasteries.

    <p>let them in this both have power to act, and be readyto submit thereto.Thus much, most holy Prelate, have I attemptedbrieﬂy to express, both for the love of you, and for thesake of general utility, with many wishes and exhortations that you endeavour to rescue our nation from itsold errors, and bring it back to a more certain anddirect path; and that, mindful of a heavenly reward,you persist in bringing to perfection this holy and excellent work, whatever be the rank or condition ofthose who attempt to impede or hinder your good exertions. For I know that there will be some who willoppose these my exhortations, and especially thosewho feel that they are themselves involved in thecrimes against which I warn you: but you must remember the apostolic answer, “ We must obey Godrather than man." For it is a command of God, “ Sellwhat ye have and give to the poor; and, unless a manshall renounce all things which he possesses, he cannotbe my disciple.” But there is in these days a traditionamong some men, who profess themselves to be servants of God, not only not to sell what they possess,but also to procure what they have not. How, then, 30:113;can a man dare, if he would enter God’s service, either aunt? allto retain those things, which he possessed whilst he {333%thwas in the secular life, or under the cloak of a more communityholy life, heap together riches which before he hadnot? Since, also, the rebuke of the Apostle is wellknown, whereby Ananias and Sapphira, attempting soto act, were not corrected by any measure of penanceor retribution, but were punished by sentence of death:and yet they sought not to gain what belonged toothers, but unseemingly to retain their own. Whereforeit is manifest, how far the thoughts of the Apostleswere from making acquisition of money, whose rule inGod’s service was this, “Blessed are ye poor, foryours is the kingdom of God.” And, on the other</p>

    <p>hand, they were alike instructed by a warning of theopposite tendency; “ Woe to you rich, for you haveyour consolation.” Or, must we suppose that theApostle erred, and wrote a falsehood, when he admonished us, saying, “Brethren, be not deceived,” andimmediately after added, “Neither the covetous,drunkards, nor the rapacious shall possess the kingdom of God.” And again, “ But know ye this, thatevery one who is a fornicator, or unclean, or covetous,or rapacious, which is the service of idols, has no inheritance in the kingdom of God or Christ." Since,therefore, the Apostle expressly names covetousnessand rapacity to be idolatry, how can those be wrong,who either have kept back their hands from signing adeed of wicked trafﬁcking, even in deﬁance of theking’s command, or who have also offered their handsto cancel former unjust writings and subscriptions?And, indeed, we must wonder at the rashness ofthose foolish men, (or rather we should call them blind,and pity their wretchedness,) who, without any regardto the fear of God, are proved to cancel and set atnought what they, the apostles and prophets, havewritten by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, but nevertheless are afraid to erase or annu] what themselves,or men like themselves, have written from the dictatesof covetousness or luxury, as if, forsooth, it weresacred and sanctioned by Heaven itself. In this, unlessI am deceived, they imitate the Gentiles, who despisethe worship of God, but bow down before the deitieswhich they have conceived in their own minds, andwhich their own hands have made. These they fear,worship, adore, and pray to, being indeed worthy ofthat rebuke of our Lord’s whereby he reproved thePharisees, when they preferred their own secondaryprecepts to the Law of God : “ Why do ye also transgress the word of God through your traditions ?"

Our Lord proteststhat “ wide is the gate and broad the way which leadeth to destruction, and multitudes there be that enterin thereat; whilst strait is the gate and narrow the waythat leadeth unto life, and few there be that ﬁnd it.”What, then, do you believe concerning the life oreternal safety of those who throughout all their livesare known to be walking through the wide gate andbroad way, and do not, even in the most triﬂing things,restrain or resist their passions, whether of the mind orbody, for the sake of a. heavenly reward? Unless Love oftha- . . . . ldi perhaps, thelr alms, which amid their daily covetous-æurnp-t'i'bleness and enjoyments they give to the poor, are to be gfnGhou-fmeconsidered as able to exempt them from blame; whereasthe hand itself, as well as the conscience which offersa gift to God, ought to be pure and free from offence.Or unless, also, they may be thought to be redeemed,now they are dead, by others, through the mystery ofthe holy oblation, of which , whilst they were alive, theyappeared unworthy? Does the fault of covetousnessappear to be triﬂing in them? I will speak a little morefully on this point. This it was which rendered Balaam, a man full of the spirit of prophecy, an outcastfrom the lot of the saints. It was this which pollutedAchan with sharing in the cursed thing, and therebydestroyed him. It stripped Saul of the diadem of thekingdom; it deprived Gehazi of the merits of prophecy, and deﬁled him and his seed with a perpetualleprosy. It cast down Judas Iscariot from the gloryof his apostleship: Ananias and Sapphira, of whom wehave before made mention, thereby became unworthyof the society of the monks, and were punished by the</p>
    <p>etiam corporis morte mulctavit, et, ut ad superioraveniamus, hæc angelos a cælo dejecit, et protoplastosa paradiso perpetuæ voluptatis expulit. Et si nossevis, hic est ille triceps inferorum canis, cui fabulæCerberi nomen indiderunt, a cujus rabidis dentibus nosprohibens Joannes apostolus ait, “ Carissimi, nolitediligere mundum, neque ea. quæ in mundo sunt. Siquis diligit mundum, non est caritas Patris in eo.Quoniam omne quod in mundo est concupiscentiacarnis est, et concupiscentia oculorum et superbia vitæ,quæ non est ex Patre, sed ex mundo est." Hæccontra virus avaritiæ breviter sunt dicta. Ceterumsi de ebrietate, commessatione, luxuria, et ceterishujusmodi contagionibus pari ratione tractare voluerimus, epistolæ modus in immensum extenderetur.Gratia te summi Pastoris ad pastionem ovium suarumsalutiferam perpetuo conservet incolumem, dilectissimein Christo antistes.

    <p>death of the body: and, to turn to heavenly examples,the angels were thereby cast down from heaven, theﬁrst created beings expelled from a paradise of endlessenjoyment. And if you must know, this is that threeheaded dog of Hell called Cerberus in the fables,from whose ravening teeth the Apostle John wouldsave us, when he says, “ Beloved, love not the worldnor those things that be therein: if any man love theworld, the love of the Father is not in him. For everything which is in the world, is the desire of the ﬂesh,and the desire of the eyes, and the pride of life, whichis not of the Father, but is of the world.” Thus muchbrieﬂy have I said against the poison of covetousness..But if I were to treat in like manner of drunkenness,feasting, luxury, and other contagions of the same kind,my letter would be indeﬁnitely lengthened. May thegrace of the Chief Shepherd ever keep you safe for thewholesome feeding of his ﬂock, Prelate, most belovedin our Lord. AMEN.</p>
