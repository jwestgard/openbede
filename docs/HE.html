          <p>ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORYOF THEENGLISH NATION.BOOK I.PREFACE.—To THE MOST GLORIOUS lea CEOLWULPH,BEDE, THE SERVANT or CHRIST AND PRIEST.H FORMERLY, at your request,most readily transmitted to youA the Ecclesiastical History of theEnglish Nation, which I had newlypublished, for you to read, and giveW it your approbation; and I nowï send it again to be transcribed,and more fully considered at yourleisure. And I cannot but commend the sincerity andzeal, with which you not only diligently give ear to hearthe words of the Holy Scripture, but also industriouslytake care to become acquainted with the actions andsayings of former men of renown, especially of our ownnation. For if history relates good things of good men,the attentive bearer is excited to imitate that which isgood; or if it mentions evil things of wicked persons,nevertheless the religious and pious hearer or reader,shunning that which is hurtful and perverse, is the moreearnestly excited to perform those things which heknows to be good, and worthy of God. Of which youalso being deeply sensible, are desirous that the saidhistory should be more fully made familiar to yourself,B 2</p>

          <p>and to those over whom the Divine Authority has appointed you governor, from your great regard to theirgeneral welfare. But that I may remove all occasion ofdoubting the truth of what I have written, both fromyourself and other readers or hearers of this history, Iwill brieﬂy intimate from what authors I chieﬂy learnedthe same.My principal authority and aid in this work was thelearned and reverendAbbotAlbinus; who was educated in Albinuthe Church of Canterbury by those venerable and learned 3333,31".men, Archbishop Theodore of blessed memory, and theAbbot Adrian, and transmitted to me by Nothelm, the 2:33:- .pious priest of the Church of London, either in writing, "omenor by word of mouth of the same Nothelm, all that hethought worthy of memory, that had been done in theprovince of Kent, or the adjacent parts, by the disciplesof the blessed Pope Gregory, as he had learned thesame either from written records, or the traditions ofhis ancestors. The same Nothelm afterwards went toRome, and by permission of the present Pope Gregory,searched into the archives of the holy Roman Church,where he found some epistles of the blessed Pope Gregory,and other popes; and on his return home, by the advice ofthe aforesaid :most reverend father Albinus, he broughtthem to me, to be inserted in my history. Thus, fromthe beginning of this volume to the time when theEnglish nation received the faith of Christ, have wecollected the writings of our predecessors, and fromthem gathered matter for our history; but from thattime till the present, what was transacted in the Churchof Canterbury, by the disciples of St. Gregory or theirsuccessors, and under what kings the same happened,has been conveyed to us by Nothelm through the industry of the aforesaid Abbot Albinus. They also partlyinformed me by what bishops and under what kings theprovinces of the East and West Saxons, as also of theEast Angles, and of the Northumbrians, received the</p>

Sed et Daniel, reverendissimus Occidentalium Saxonum episcopus, qui nunc usquesuperest, nonnulla. mihi de historia ecclesiastica. provinciæ ipsius, simul et proxima illi Australium Saxonum,nec non et Vectæ insulæ, literis mandata declaravit.Qualiter vero per ministerium Cedd et Ceaddæ, religiosorum Christi sacerdotum, vel provincia Merciorum adfidem Christi, quam non noverat, pervenerit, vel provincia Orientalium Saxonum ﬁdem, quam olim exsufﬂavetat, recuperaverit, qualis etiam ipsorum patrum vita.vel obitus exstiterit, diligenter a fratribus monasterii,quod ab ipsis conditum Lestingau cognominatur, agnovimus.

          <p>faith of Christ. In short, I was chieﬂy encouraged töundertake this work by the persuasions of the sameAlbinus. In like manner, Daniel, the most reverendBishop of the West Saxons, who is still living, communicated to me in writing some things relating to theEcclesiastical History of that province, and the nextadjoining to it of the South Saxons, as also of the Isleof Wight. But how, by the pious ministry of Cedd andCeadda,, the province of the Mercians was brought tothe faith of Christ, which they knew not before, and howthat of the East Saxons recovered the same, after havingexpelled it, and how those fathers lived and died, welearned from the brethren of the monastery, which wasbuilt by them, and is called Laestingau. What ecclesiastical transactions took place in the province of the EastAngles, was partly made known to us from the writingsand tradition of our ancestors, and partly by relation ofthe most reverend Abbot Esius. What was done towardspromoting the faith, and what was the sacerdotal succession in the province of Lindsey, we had either fromthe letters of the most reverend prelate Cunebert, or by 53:13"word of mouth from other persons of good credit. But 'what was done in the Church throughout the provinceof the Northumbrians, from the time when they receivedthe faith of Christ till this present, I received not fromany particular author, but by the faithful testimony ofinnumerable witnesses, who might know or rememberthe same; besides what I had of my own knowledge.VVherein it is to be observed, that what I have writtenconcerning our most holy father, and Bishop Cuthbert, SLCuthbert.either in this volume, or in my treatise on his life andactions, I partly took, and faithfully copied from whatI found written of him by the brethren of the Churchof Lindisfarne; but at the same time took care to addsuch things as I could myself have knowledge of by thefaithful testimony of such as knew him. And I humblyentreat the reader, that if he shall in this that we have</p>

I.—0F THE SITUATION OF BRITAIN AND IRELAND,AND OF THEIR ANCIENT INHABITANTB.' sRITAIN, an island in the ocean, Emun.ïformerly called Albion, is situatedﬂbetween the north and west, facing,, ‘9'; though at a. considerable distance,the coasts of Germany, France, and:(,Spain which form the greatest part- "(of Europe. It extends 800 milesin length towards the north, and 13 200 miles m breadth,except where several promontories extend further inbreadth, by which its compass is made to be 3675 miles.To the south, as you pass along the nearest shore of the m 'ita-tion.Belgic Gaul, the ﬁrst place in Britain which opens tothe eye, is the city of Rutubi Portus, by the Englishcorrupted into Reptacestir. The distance from henceacross the sea. to Gessoriacum, the nearest shore of theMorini, is 50 miles, or as some writers say, 450 furlongs.On the back of the island, where it opens upon theboundless ocean, it has the islands called Orcades.Britain excels for grain and trees, and is well adapted</p>

It also pro- island“:duces vines in some places, and has plenty of land and 'water fowls of several sorts; it is remarkable also forrivers abounding in ﬁsh, and plentiful springs. It hasthe greatest plenty of salmon and eels; seals are alsofrequently taken, and dolphins, as also whales; besidesmany sorts of shell-ﬁsh, such as muscles, in which areoften found excellent pearls of all colours, red, purple,violet, and green, but mostly white. There is alsoa. great abundance of cockles, of which the scarlet dyeis made; a most beautiful colour, which never fadeswith the heat of the sun or the washing of the rain; butthe older it is, the more beautiful it becomes. It hasboth salt and hot springs, and from them ﬂow riverswhich furnish hot baths, proper for all ages and sexes,and arranged according. For water, as St. Basil says,receives the heating quality, when it runs along certainmetals, and becomes not only hot but scalding. Britainhas also many veins of metals, as copper, iron, lead, andsilver ; it has much and excellent jet, which is black andsparkling, glittering at the ﬁre, and when heated, drivesaway serpents; being warmed with rubbing, it holdsfast whatever is applied to it, like amber. The islandwas formerly embellished with twenty-eight noble cities,besides innumerable castles, which were all stronglysecured with walls, towers, gates, and locks. And,from its lying almost under the North Pole, the nightsare light in summer, so that at midnight the beholdersare often in doubt whether the evening twilight stillcontinues, or that of the moming is coming on; for thesun, in the night, returns under the earth, through thenorthern regions at no great distance from them. Forthis reason the days are of a great length in summer, ason the contrary, the nights are in winter, the sun thenwithdrawing into the southern parts, so that they areeighteen hours long. Thus the nights are extraordinarily short in summer, and the days in winter, that is,</p>

          <p>of only six equinoctial hours. \Vhereas, in Armenia,Macedonia, Italy, and other countries of the same latitude, the longest day or night extends but to ﬁfteenhours, and the shortest to nine.This island at present, following the number of the :::-inhibibooks in which the Divine law was written, contains 'ﬁve nations, the English, Britons, Scots, Picts, andLatins, each in its own peculiar dialect cultivating thesublime study of Divine truth. The Latin tongue is,by the study of the Scriptures, become common to allthe rest. At ﬁrst this island had no other inhabitants butthe Britons, from whom it derived its name, and whocoming over into Britain, as is reported, from Armorica,possessed themselves of the southern parts thereof.When they, beginning at the south, had made themselves masters of the greatest part of the island, it happened, that the nation of the Picts, from Scythia, as isreported, putting to sea, in a. few long ships, were drivenby the Winds beyond the shores of Britain, and arrivedon the northern coasts of Ireland, where; ﬁnding thenation of the Scots, they begged to be allowed to settleamong them, but could not succeed in obtaining theirrequest. Ireland is the greatest island next to Britain,and lies to the west of it; but as it is shorter thanBritain to the north, so, on the other hand, it i'uns outfar beyond it to the south, opposite to the northernparts of Spain, though a. spacious sea lies between them.The Picts, as has been said, arriving in this island bysea, desired to have a place granted them in which theymight settle. The Scots answered that the island couldnot contain them both; but “ we can give you goodadvice,” said they, “what to do; we know there isanother island, not far from ours, to the eastward, whichwe often see at a. distance, when the days are clear.If you will go thither, you will obtain settlements; orif they should oppose you, you shall have our assistance.”The Picts, accordingly, sailing over into Britain, began</p>

Scotis, ea solumconditione dare consenserunt, ut ubi res veniret in dubium, magis de feminea regum prosapia quam de masculina. regem sibi eligerent; quod usque hodie apudPictos constat esse servatum. Procedente autem tempore, Britannia, post Britones et Pictos, tertiam Scotorum nationem in Pictorum parte recepit; qui, duceReuda, de Hibernia progressi, vel amicitia vel ferrosibimet inter eos sedes, quas hactenus habent, vindicarunt; a. quo videlicet duce usque hodie Dalreudinivocantur, nam lingua eorum ‘ daal’ partem significat.Hibernia autem et latitudine sui status, et salubritateac serenitate aefum, multum Britannia: præstat, ita utraro ibi nix plus quam triduana remaneat; nemo propterhiemem aut fæna secet æstate, aut stabula. fabricetjumentis; nullum ibi reptile videri soleat, nullus vivereserpens valeat; nam sæpe illo de Britannia allati serpentes, mox ut, proximante terris navigio, odore aerisillius attacti fuerint, intereunt; quin potius omnia pene,quæ de eadem insula sunt, contra venenum valent.Denique vidimus, quibusdam a. serpente percussis, rasafolia. codicum, qui de Hibernia fuerant, et ipsam rasuramaquæ immissam ac potui datam, talibus protinus totamvim veneni grassantis, totum inﬂati corporis absumsisseac sedasse tumorem.

Hæc autem proprie pa.tria Scotorum est; ab hac egressi, ut diximus, tertiamin Britannia Britonibus et Pictis gentem addiderunt.Est autem sinus maris permaximus, qui antiquitus gentem Britonum a Pictis secemebat, qui ab occidente in</p>
          <p>to inhabit the northern parts thereof, for the Britons werepossessed of the southern. Now the Picts had no wives,and asked them of the Scots; who would not consent togrant them upon any other terms, than that when anydifﬁculty should arise, they should choose a king fromthe female royal race rather than from the male: whichcustom, as is well known, has been observed among thePicts to this day. In process of time, Britain, besidesthe Britons and the Picts, received a. third nation, theScots, who, migrating from Ireland under their leaderReuda, either by fair means, or by force of arms, secured to themselves those settlements among the Pictswhich they still possess. From the name of their commander, they are to this day called Dalreudins; for intheir language Dal signiﬁes a part. .Ireland, in breadth, and for wholesomeness and serenity anmm.of climate, far surpasses Britain; for the snow scarcelyever lies there above three days: no man makes hay inthe summer for winter’s provision, or builds stables forhis beasts of burden. No reptiles are found there, andno snake can live there; for though often carried thitherout of Britain, as soon as the ship comes near theshore, and the scent of the air reaches them, they die.On the contrary, almost all things in the island are goodagainst poison. In short, we have known that whensome persons have been bitten by serpents, the scrap—ings of leaves of books that were brought out of Ireland,being put into water, and given them to drink, haveimmediately expelled the spreading poison, and assuagedthe swelling. The island abounds in milk and honey,nor is there any want of vines, ﬁsh or fowl; and it isremarkable for deer and goats. It is properly thecountry of the Scots, who, migrating from thence, ashas been said, added a third nation in Britain to theBritons and the Picts. There is a very large gulf ofthe sea, which formerly divided the nation of the Pictsfrom the Britons; which gulf runs from the west very</p>

Returning into Gaul, he put his legions intowinter-quarters, and gave orders for building six hundred sail of both sorts. With these he again passedover early in spring into Britain, but, whilst he wasmarching with a. large army towards the enemy, the ships,riding at anchor, were by a tempest either dashed oneagainst another, or driven upon the sands and wrecked.Forty of them perished, the rest were, with much difﬁculty, repaired.

          <p>CHAP.

He was the seventeenth from Augustus, and reigned seventeen years. Being naturallystern, and engaged in many wars, he governed the statevigorously, but with much trouble. Having been victorious in all the grievous civil wars which happened inhis time, he was drawn into Britain by the revolt ofalmost all the confederate tribes; and, after many greatand dangerous battles, he thought ﬁt to divide that partof the island, which he had recovered from the otherunconquered nations, not with a. wall, as some imagine,but with a rampart. For a wall is made of stones, buta rampart, with which camps are fortiﬁed to repel theassaults of enemies, is made of sods, cut out of theearth, and raised above the ground all round like a wall,having in front of it the ditch whence the sods weretaken, and strong stakes of wood ﬁxed upon its top.Thus Severus drew a. great ditch and strong rampart,fortiﬁed with several towers, from sea to sea; and wasafterwards taken sick and died at York, leaving two Severundiusous, Bassianus and Geta,; of whom Greta. died, adjudged 3:23.a. public enemy; but Bassianus, having taken the sur- "”1 Gmname of Antoninus, obtained the empire. _CHAP.

          <p>their time, one Carausius, of very mean birth, but an emm.expert and able soldier, being appointed to guard thesea—coasts, then infested by the Franks and Saxons,acted more to the prejudice than to the advantage of thecommonwealth; and from his not restoring the bootytaken from the robbers to its owners, but keeping allto himself, it was suspected that by intentional neglecthe suffered the enemy to infest the frontiers. Hearing,therefore, that an order was sent by Maximian that heshould be put to death, he took upon him the imperialrobes, and possessed himself of Britain, and having mostvaliantly retained it for the space of seven years, he wasat length put to death by the treachery of his associate,Allectus. The usurper, having thus got the island from AnmuCarausius, held it three years, and was then vanquishedby Asclepiodotus, the captain of the Praetorian bands,who thus at the end of ten years restored Britain to theRoman empire. Meanwhile, Diocletian in the east, andMaximian Herculius in the west, commanded the churchesto be destroyed, and the Christians to be slain. Thispersecution was the tenth since the reign of Nero, andwas more lasting and bloody than all the others beforeit; for it was carried on incessantly for the space of tenyears, with burning of churches, outlawing of innocentpersons, and the slaughter of martyrs. At length, itreached Britain also, and many persons, with the constancy of martyrs, died in the confession of their faith.CHAP. VII.—-THE PASSION OF s'r.

          <p>Qui videlicet Albanus paganus adhuc, cum perfidorumprincipum mandata adversum Christianos sævirent, clericum quendam persecutores fugientem hospitio recepit;quem dum orationibus continuis ac vigiliis die noctuquestudere conspiceret, subito Divina gratia respectus, exemplum ﬁdei ac pietatis illius coepit æmulari, ac salutaribus ejus exhortationibus paulatim edoctus, relictis idololatriae tenebris, Christianus integro ex corde factus est.Cumque præfatus clericus aliquot diebus apud eumhospitaretur, pervenit ad aures nefandi principis confessorem Christi, cui necdum fuerat locus martyrii deputatus, penes Albanum latere. Unde statim jussit militeseum diligentius inquirere ; qui cum ad tugurium martyrispervenissent, mox se sanctus Albanus pro hospite acmagistro suo, ipsius habitu, id est, caracalla, qua vestiebatur indutus, militibus exhibuit, atque ad judicem vinctus perductus est.Contigit autem judicem ea. hora, qua ad eum Albanusadducebatur, aris assistere ac daemonibus hostias oﬁ'en'e;cumque vidisset Albanum, mox ira. succensus nimia. quodse ille ultro pro hospite , quem susceperat, militibus oﬂ'erreac discrimini dare praesumsisset, ad simulacra. dæmonum,quibus assistebat, eum jussit pertrahi ; “ Quia rebellem,"inquiens, “ac sacrilegum celare quam militibus redderemaluisti, ut contemtor divum meritam blasphemiæ suæpoenam lueret, quæcumque illi debebantur supplicia tusolvere habes, si a cultu nostræ religionis discederetentas.” At sanctus Albanus, qui se ultro persecutoribusfidei Christianum esse prodiderat, nequaquam minasprincipis metuit ; sed accinctus armis militiæ spiritualis,palam se jussis illius parere nolle pronunciabat. Tumjudex, “ Cujus," inquit, “ familiae vel generis es ?" Al</p>
          <p>This Alban being yet a. Pagan, at the time when thecrueltiæ of wicked princes were raging against Christians,gave entertainment in his house to a. certain clergyman,ﬂying from the persecutors. This man he observed to beengaged in continual prayer and watching day and night;when on a sudden the Divine grace shining on him, hebegan to imitate the example of faith and piety which wasset before him, and being gradually instructed by hiswholesome admonitione, he cast off the darkness of idolatry, and became a Christian in all sincerity of heart.The aforesaid clergyman having been some days entertained by him, it came to the ears of the wicked prince,that this holy confessor of Christ, whose time of martyrdom had not yet come, was concealed at Alban’s house.Whereupon he sent some soldiers to make a strict searchafter him. When they came to the martyr’s house, St.Alban immediately presented himself to the soldiers, instead of his guest and master, in the habit or long coatwhich he wore, and was led bound before the judge.It happened that the judge, at the time when Albanwas carried before him, was standing at the altar, andoffering sacriﬁce to devils. When he saw Alban, beingmuch enraged that he should thus, of his own accord,put himself into the hands of the soldiers, and incur such A.D. aou.danger in behalf of his guest, he commanded him to bedragged up to the images of the devils, before which hestood, saying, “ Because you have chosen to conceal arebellious and sacrilegious person, rather than to deliverhim up to the soldiers, that his contempt of the godsmight meet with the penalty due to such blasphemy, youshall undergo all the punishment that was due to him, ifyou abandon the worship of our religion.” But St.Alban, who had voluntarily declared himself a. Christianto the persecutors of the faith, was not at all daunted atthe prince‘s threats, but putting on the amour of spiritual warfare, publicly declared that he would not obeythe commands. Then said the judge, “ Of what family</p>
          <p>banus respondit, “ Quid ad te pertinet qua sim stirpegenitus? sed si veritatem religionis audire desideras,Christianum jam me esse Christianisque ofﬁciis vacatecognosce.” Ait judex, “ Nomen tuum quæro, quod sinemora mihi insinua.” Et ille, “ Albanus," inquit, “ aparentibus vocor, et Deum verum ac vivum, qui universacreavit, adoro semper et. colo." Tum judex repletusiracundia dixit, “ Si vis perennis vitæ felicitate perfrui,diis magnis sacrificare ne differas." Albanus respondit,“ Sacriﬁcia. hæc, quæ a vobis redduntur dæmonibus, necauxiliari subjectis possunt, nec supplicantium sibi desideria. vel vota. complere; quin immo, quieunque his sacriﬁcia simulacris obtulerit æternas inferni poenas pro mercede recipiet."His auditis, judex nimio furore commotus, cædi sanctum Dei confessorem a. tortoribus præcepit, autumans severberibus, quam verbis non poterat, cordis ejus emollire_ constantiam ; qui cum tormentis aﬂiceretur acerrimis,patienter hæc pro Domino, immo gaudenter, ferebat. Atubi judex tormentis illum superari, vel a. cultu Christianareligionis revocari, non posse persensit, capite eum plectijussit. Cumque ad mortem duceretur, pervenit ad flumenquod muro et arena, ubi feriendus erat, meatu rapidissimodividebatur ; viditque ibi non parvam hominum multitudinem utriusque sexus, conditionis diversæ et ætatis,quæ, sine dubio, Divinitatis instinctu ad obsequium beatissimi confessoris ac martyris vocabatur, et ita ﬂuminisipsius occupabat pontem, ut intra vesperam transire vixposset; denique, cunctis pene egressis, judex sine obsequio in civitate substiterat. Igitur sanctus Albanus, cuiardens inerat devotio mentis ad martyrium ocius pervenire, accessit ad torrentem, et dirigens ad coelum oculos,</p>
          <p>or race are you?”—-—“ What does it concern you,” answered Alban, “ of what stock I am? If you desire tohear the truth of my religion, be it known to you, thatI am now a Christian, and bound by Christian duties.”—“ I ask your name ? " said the judge; “ tell me it immediately.”——“ I am called Alban by my parents,” repliedhe; “ and I worship and adore the true and living God,who created all things.” Then the jüdge, inﬂamed withanger, said, “ If you will enjoy the happiness of eternallife, do not delay to offer sacriﬁce to the great gods."Alban rejoined, “ These sacriﬁces, which by you areoffered to devils, neither can avail the subjects, nor answer the wishes or desires of those that offer up theirsupplications to them. On the contrary, whosoever shalloffer sacriﬁce to these images, shall receive the everlasting pains of hell for his reward.”The judge, hea‘ring these words, and being much incensed, ordered this holy confessor of God to be scourgedby the executioners, believing he might by stripes shakethat constancy of heart, on which he could not prevailby words. He, being most cruelly tortured, bore thesame patiently, or rather joyfully, for our Lord’s sake.When the judge perceived‘ that he was not to be overcome by turtures, or Withdrawn from the exercise of theChristian religion, he ordered him to be put to death.Being led to execution, he came to a river, which, witha. most rapid course, ran between the wall of the townand the arena where he was to be executed. He theresaw a multitude of persons of both sexes, and of severalages and conditions, which was doubtlessly assembled byDivine instinct, to attend the blessed confessor andmartyr, and had so taken up the bridge on the river,that he could scarce pass over that evening. In short,almost all had gone out, so that the judge remained inthe city without attendance. St. Alban, therefore, urgedby an ardent and devout wish to arrive quickly at martyrdom, drew near to the stream, and on lifting up his</p>

          <p>eyes to heaven, the channel was immediately dried up,and he perceived that the water had departed and madeway for him to pass. Among the rest, the executioner,who was to have put him to death, observed this, andmoved by Divine inspiration, hastened to meet him atthe place of execution, and casting down the swordwhich he had carried ready drawn, fell at his feet,praying that he might rather suffer with the martyr,whom he was ordered to execute, or, if possible, insteadof him.Whilst he thus from a persecutor was become a. companion in the faith, and the other executioners hesitatedto take up the sword which was lying on the ground, thereverend confessor, accompanied by the multitude, ascended a hill, about 500 paces from the place, adorned,or rather clothed with all kinds of ﬂowers, having itssides neither perpendicular, nor even craggy, but slopingdown into a most beautiful plain, worthy from its lovelyappearance to be the scene of a. 'martyr's sufferings. Onthe top of this hill, St. Alban prayed that God wouldgive him water, and immediately a living spring brokeout before his feet, the course being conﬁned, so that all men perceived that the river also had been dried up inconsequence of the martyr’s presence. Nor was it likelythat the martyr, who had left no water remaining in theriver, should want some on the top of the hill, unless hethought it suitable to the occasion. The river, havingperformed the holy service, returned to its natural course,leaving a testimony of its obedience. Here, therefore,the head of our most courageous martyr was struck oü",and here he received the crown of life, which God haspromised to those who love him. But he who gave thewicked stroke, was not permitted to rejoice over thedeceased ; for his eyes dropped upon the ground togetherwith the blessed martyr’s head.At the same time was also beheaded the soldier, whobefore, through the Divine admonition, refused to give..</p>

St. Augustine, and the other orthodoxfathers, quoted many thousand catholic authorities againstthem, yet they would not correct their madness; but, onthe contrary, their folly was rather increased by contradiction, and they refused to embrace the truth; whichProsper, the rhetorician, has beautifully expressed thusin heroic verse :—“ A scribbler vile, inﬂamed with hellish spite,Against the great Augustine dared to write:Presumptuous serpent! from what midnight denDurst thou to crawl on earth and look at men?Sure thou wast fed on Britain’s sea—girt plains,Or in thy breast Vesuvian sulphur reigns.”</p>

XL—How DURING THE REIGN OF uomonws, GRATIAN AND coxsmmmz wm CREATED TYBANTS IN nmTAIN; AND SOON AFTER THE FORMER WAS sum INBRITAIN, AND THE mrum IN GAUL.IN the year 4-07, Honorius, the younger son of Theodo- $331103; 'sins, and the forty-fourth from Augustus, being emperor,two years before the invasion of Rome by Alaric, king ofthe Goths, when the nations of the Alani, Suevi, Vandals,and many others with them, having defeated the Franksand passed the Rhine, ravaged all Gaul, Gratianus Municeps was set up as tyrant and killed. In his place, Constantine, one of the meanest soldiers, only for his name’ssake, and without any worth to recommend him, waschosen emperor. As soon as he had taken upon him thecommand, he passed over into France, where being oftenimposed upon by the barbarians with faithless treaties, hecaused much injury to the Commonwealth. WhereuponCount Constantius, by the command of Honorius, matching into Gaul with an army, besieged him in the city ofArles, and put him to death. His son Constans, whomof a. monk he had created Cæsar, was also put to deathby his own Count Gerontius, at Vienne.Rome was taken by the Goths, in the year from itsfoundation, 1164. Then the Romans ceased to rule inBritain, almost 470 years after Caius J ulius Caesar entered the island. They resided within the rampart, which,as we have mentioned, Severus made across the island,on the south side of it, as the cities, temples, bridges,and paved roads there made, testify to this day; butthey had a right of dominion over the farther parts ofBritain, as also over the islands that are beyond Britain.</p>

Where—upon they suffered many years under two very savageforeign nations, the Scots from the west, and the Pictsfrom the north. We call these foreign nations, not onaccount of their being seated out of Britain, but becausethey were remote from that part of it which was pos—sessed by the Britons; two inlets of the sea lying betwixtthem, one of which runs in far and broad into the landof Britain, from the Eastern Ocean, and the other fromthe Western, though they do not reach so as to touchone another. The eastern has in the midst of it thecity Giudi. The western has on it, that is, on the righthand thereof, the city Alcluith, which in their languagesigniﬁes the Rock Cluith, for it is close by the river ofthat name.On account of the irruption of these nations, the A.D.m.Britons sent messengers to Rome with letters inmournful manner, praying for succours, and promisedperpetual subjection, provided that the impending enemyshould be driven away. An armed legion was immediately sent them, which, arriving in the island, andengaging the. enemy, slew a great multitude of them,drove the rest out of the territories of their allies, andhaving delivered them from their cruel oppressors,advised them to build a. wall between the two seas, across</p>

          <p>the island, that it might secure them, and keep off theenemy; and thus they returned home with great triumph. The islanders, raising the wall, as they had beendirected, not of stone, as having no artist capable ofsuch a work, but of sods, made it of no use. However,they drew it for many miles between the two bays orinlets of the seas, which we have spoken of ; to the endthat where the defence of the water was wanting, theymight use the rampart to defend their borders from theirruptions of the enemies. Of which work there erected,that is, of a rampart of extraordinary breadth and height,there are evident remains to be seen at this day. Itbegins at about two miles’ distance from the monastery A.D. 416.of Abercurnig, on the west, at a place called in thePictish language, Peanfahel, but in the English tongue,Penneltun, and running to the westward, ends near thecity Alcluith.But the former enemies, when they perceived that theRoman soldiers were gone, immediately coming by sea,broke into the borders, trampled and overran all places,and, like men mowing ripe corn, bore down all beforethem. Hereupon messengers are again sent to Rome,imploring aid, lest their wretched country should beutterly extirpated, and the name of a Roman provinceso long renowned among them, being overthrown by thecruelties of barbarous foreigners, might grow contemptible. A legion is accordingly sent again, andarriving unexpectedly in autumn, made great slaughterof the enemy, obliging all those that could escape, toﬂee beyond the sea; whereas before, they were wontyearly to carry oﬁ' their booty without any opposition.Then the Romans declared to the. Britons, that theycould not for the future undertake such troublesomeexpeditions for their sake, advising them rather tohandle their weapons, like men, and undertake themselves the charge of engaging their enemies, who wouldnot prove too powerful for them, unless they were de</p>

          <p>terred by cowardice; and, thinking that it might besome help to the allies, whom they were forced to abandon, they built a strong stone wall from sea to sea, ina straight line between the towns that had been therebuilt for fear of the enemy, and not far from the trenchof Severus. This famous wall, which is still to be seen,was built at the public and private expense, the Britonsalso lending their assistance. It is eight feet in breadth,and twelve in height, in a straight line from east towest, as is still visible to beholders. This being ﬁnished,they gave that dispirited people good advice, with patterns to furnish them with arms. Besides, they builttowers on the sea-coast to the southward, at properdistances, where their ships were, because there alsothe irruptions of the barbarians were apprehended, andso took leave of their friends, never to return again.After their departure, the Scots and Picts, understanding that they had declared they would come nomore, speedily returned, and growing more conﬁdentthan they had been before, occupied all the northernand farthest part of the island, as far as the wall.Hereupon a timorous guard was placed upon the wall,where they pined away day and night in the utmostfear. On the other side, the enemy attacked them withhooked weapons, by which the cowardly defendants weredragged from the wall, and dashed against the ground.At last, the Britons, forsaking their cities and wall, tookto ﬂight and were dispersed. The enemy pursued, and 31:32?the slaughter was greater than on any former occasion; the Britonufor the wretched natives were torn in pieces by theirenemies, as lambs are torn by wild beasts. Thus beingexpelled their dwellings and possessions, they savedthemselves from starvation, by robbing and plunderingone another, adding to the calamities occasioned byforeigners, by their own domestic broils, till the wholecountry was left destitute of food, except such as couldbe procured in the chase.</p>

And, though the year before this, Bledla. had been murdered by the treachery of his brother Attila, yet Attilahimself remained so intolerable an enemy to the Republic,that he ravaged almost all Europe, invading and destroying cities and castles. At the same time there was afamine at Constantinople, and shortly after, a plaguefollowed, and a. great part of the walls of that city, withﬁfty-seven towers, fell to the ground. Many cities alsowent to ruin, and the famine and pestilential state of theair destroyed thousands of men and cattle.</p>

These continuallymade excursions from the mountains, caves, and woods,and, at length, began to inﬂict severe losses on theil;enemies, who had been for so many years plundering thecountry. The Irish robbers thereupon returned home,in order to come again soon after. The Picts, both thenand afterwards, remained quiet in the farthest part ofthe island; save that, sometimes, they would do somemischief, and carry oﬁ' booty from the Britons.When, however, the ravages of the enemy at lengthceased, the island began to abound with such plenty ofgrain as had never been known in any age before; withplenty, luxury increased, and this was immediately attended with all sorts of crimes; in particular, cruelty,hatred of truth, and love of falsehood; insomuch, that ifany one among them happened to be milder than therest, and inclined to truth, all the rest abhorred andpersecuted him, as if he had been the enemy of hiscountry. Nor were the laity only guilty of these things,but even our Lord’s own ﬂock, and his pastors also, addicting themselves to drunkenness, animosity, litigiousness, contention, envy, and other such like crimes, andcasting of? the light yoke of Christ.

Fromthe Saxons, that is, the country which is now called OldSaxony, came the East-Saxons, the South-Saxons, andthe \Vest-Saxons. From the Angles, that is the countryWhich is called Anglia, and which is said, from thattime, to remain desert to this day, between the provincesof the J utes and the Saxons, are descended the EastAngles, the Midland-Angles, Mercians, all the race ofthe Northumbrians, that is, of those nations that dwellon the north side of the river Humber, and the othernations of the English.

Public as well as private structures were over—turned ; the priests were everywhere slain before thealtars; the prelates and the people, without any respectof persons, were destroyed with ﬁre and sword; nor was .there any to bury those who had been thus cruelly slaughtered. Some of the miserable remainder, being takenin the mountains, were butchered in heaps. Others,spent with hunger, came forth and submitted themselvesto the enemy for food, being destined to undergo perpetual servitude, if they were not even killed upon the spot.Some with sorrowful hearts ﬂed beyond the seas. Others,continuing in their own country, led a miserable lifeamong the woods, rocks, and mountains, with scarcelyenough food to support life, and expecting every momentto be their last.CHAP.

XVII.—How GERMANUS THE BISHOP, SAILING INTOBRITAIN WITH LUPUS, FIRST QUELLED THE TEMPEST OF THESEA, AND AFTERWARDB THAT OF THE PELAGIANS, BY DIVINEPOWER.SOME few years before their arrival, the Pelagian Thel'elngianheresy, brought over by Agricola, the son of Severianus, 232».a. Pelagian bishop, had sadly corrupted the faith of theBritons. But whereas they absolutely refused to embrace that perverse doctrine, so blasphemous against thegrace of Christ, and were not able of themselves toconfute its subtilty by force of argument, they thoughtof an excellent plan, which was to crave aid of theGallicam prelates in that spiritual war. Hereuponhaving gathered a. great synod, they consulted togetherwhat persons should be sent thither, and by unanimousconsent, choice was made of the apostolical priests,Germanus, bishop of Auxerre, and Lupus of Troyes, togo into Britain to conﬁrm it in the faith. They readilycomplied with the request and commands of the holyChurch, and putting to sea, sailed half way over fromGaul to Britain with a fair wind. There on a suddenthey were obstructed by the malevolence of demons,who were jealous that such men should be sent to bringback the Britons to the faith. They raised stems, anddarkened the sky with clouds. The sails could not bearthe fury of the winds, the sailors’ skill was forced togive way, the ship was sustained by prayer, not by</p>

Then the blessedLupus and all the rest awakened their elder, that he 5333“might oppose the raging elements. He, showing him- Germanusself the more resolute in proportion to the greatness ofthe danger, called upon Christ, and having, in the nameof the Holy Trinity, sprinkled a little water, quelled theraging waves, admonished his companion, encouraged all,and all unanimously fell to prayer. The Deity heardtheir cry, the enemies were put to ﬂight, a calm ensued,the winds veering about applied themselves to forwardtheir voyage, and having soon traversed the ocean, theyenjoyed the quiet of the wished—for shore. A multitudeﬂocking thither from all parts, received the priests,whose coming had been foretold by the predictions evenof their adversaries. For the wicked spirits declaredwhat they feared, and when the priests afterwards expelled them from the bodies they had taken possessionof, they made known the nature of the tempest, and thedangers they had occasioned, and that they had beenovercome by the merits and authority of the saints.In the meantime, the apostolical priests ﬁlled theisland of Britain with the fame of their preaching andvirtues; and the word of God was by them daily administered, not only in the churches, but even in thestreets and ﬁelds, so that the Catholics were everywhereconﬁrmed, and those who had gone astray, corrected.Like the Apostles, they had honour and authority througha good conscience, obedience to their doctrine throughtheir sound learning, whilst the reward of virtue attended upon their numerous merits. Thus the generalityof the people readily embraced their opinions; theauthors of the erroneous opinions kept themselves in thebackground, and, like evil spirits, grieved for the loss</p>

At length,after mature deliberation, they had the boldness to enterthe lists, and appeared for public disputation conspicuousfor riches, glittering in apparel, and supported by theﬂatteries of many; choosing rather to hazard the combat, than to undergo the dishonour among the people ofhaving been silenced, lest they should seem by sayingnothing to condemn themselves. An immense multitudewas there assembled with their wives and children. Thepeople stood round as spectators and judges; but theparties present differed much in appearance; on the oneside was Divine faith, on the other human presumption;on the one side piety, on the other pride; on the oneside Pelagius, on the other Christ. The holy priests, Germanus and Lupus, permitted their adversaries to speakﬁrst, who long took up the time, and ﬁlled the ears withempty words. Then the venerable prelates poured forththe torrent of their apostolica] and evangelical eloquence.Their discourse was interspersed with scriptural sentences, and they supported their most weighty assertionsby reading the written testimonies of famous writers.Vanity was convinced, and perﬁdiousness confuted; so,that at every objection made against them, not beingable t3 reply, they confessed their errors. The people,who were judges, could scarcely refrain from violence,but signiﬁed their judgment by their acclamations.CHAP.

The priests, therefore,perceiving their adversaries to yield, made a short prayer,and then Germanus, full of the Holy Ghost, invoked theTrinity, and taking into his hands a casket with relics ofsaints, which hung about his neck, applied it to the girl'seyes, which were immediately delivered from darkness andﬁlled with the light of truth. The parents rejoiced, andthe people were astonished at the miracle; after which,the wicked opinions were so fully obliterated from theminds of all, that they ardently embraced the doctrineof the priests. _This damnable heresy being thus suppressed, and theauthors thereof confuted, and all the people’s heartssettled in the purity of the faith, the priests repaired tothe tomb of the martyr, St. Alban, to give thanks to Godthrough him. There Germanus, having with him relicsof all the Apostles, and of several martyrs, after offeringup his prayers, commanded the tomb to be opened, thathe might lay up therein some precious gifts; judging itconvenient, that the limbs of saints brought togetherfrom several countries, as their equal merits had procured them admission into heaven, should be preservedin one tomb. These being honourably deposited, andlaid together, he took up a parcel of dust from the placewhere the martyr’s blood had been shed, to carry awaywith him, which dust having retained the blood, it appeared that the slaughter of the martyrs had communicated a redness to it, whilst the persecutor was struckpale. In consequence of these things, an innumerablemultitude of people was that day converted to the Lord.</p>

W hilst he was thus detained some time in the same place by illness, a ﬁrebroke out in a cottage neighbouring to that in which hewas; and having burned down the other houses whichwere thatched with reed, was carried on by the wind tothe dwelling in which he lay. The people all ﬂocked tothe prelate, entreating that they might lift him in theirarms, and save him from the impending danger. He,however, rebuked them, and relying on faith, would notsuffer himself to be removed. The multitude, in despair,ran to oppose the conﬁagration; however, for the greatermanifestation of the Divine power, whatsoever the crowdendeavoured to save, was destroyed; but what he whowas disabled and motionless occupied, the ﬂame avoided,sparing the house that gave entertainment to the holyman, and raging about on every side of it; whilst thehouse in which he lay appeared untouched, amid the general conﬂagration. The multitude rejoiced at the miracle,and praised the superior power of God. An inﬁnite number of the poorer sort watched day and night before thecottage; some to heal their souls, and some their bodies.It is impossible to relate what Christ wrought by hisservant, what wonders the sick man performed: forwhilst he would suffer no medicines to be applied to hisdistemper, he one night saw a person in garments asWhite as snow, standing by him, who, reaching out hishand, seemed to raise him up, and ordered him to standF</p>

Thus,by these holy apostolic men, Christ himself commandedin their camp. The holy days of Lent were also at hand,and were rendered more religious by the presence of thepriests, insomuch that the people being instructed bydaily sermons, resorted in crowds to be baptized; formost of the army desired admission to the saving water;a. church was prepared with boughs for the feast of theresurrection of our Lord, and so ﬁtted up in that martialcamp, as if it were in a city. The army advanced, stillwet with the baptismal water; the faith of the peoplewas strengthened; and whereas human power had before been despaired of, the Divine assistance was nowrelied upon. The enemy received advice of the state ofthe army, and not questioning their success against anunarmed multitude, hastened forwards, but their approach was, by the scouts, made known to the Britons;the greater part- of whose forces being just come fromthe font, after the celebration of Easter, and preparingto arm and carry on the war, Germanus declared hewould be their leader.

In that place he drew up his inexperiencedtroops, himself acting as their general. A multitude ofﬁerce enemies appeared, whom as soon as those that layin ambush saw approaching, Germanus, bearing in hishands the standard, instructed his men all in a loud voiceto repeat his words, and the enemy advancing securely,as thinking to take them by surprise, the priests threetimes cried, Hallelujah. A universal shout of the sameword followed, and the hills resounding the echo on allsides, the enemy was struck with dread, fearing, that notonly the neighbouring rocks, but even the very skies,were falling upon them; and such was their terror, thattheir feet were not swift enough to deliver them from it.They ﬂed in disorder, casting away their arms, and wellsatisﬁed if, with their naked bodies, they could escape thedanger; many of them, in their precipitate and hastyﬂight, were swallowed up by the river which they werepassing. The Britons, without the loss of a man, beheld .their vengeance complete, and became inactive spectatorsof their victory.

The holy ")- “7'Germanus was entreated by all the priests, that he wouldagain defend the cause of God, which he had before asserted. He speedily complied with their request; andtaking with him Severus, a man of singular sanctity,who was disciple to the most holy father, Lupus, bishopof Troyes, and afterwards, as bishop of Treves, preachedthe word of God in the adjacent parts of Germany, putto sea, and was calmly wafted over into Britain.In the meantime, the wicked spirits ﬂying about thewhole island, foretold by constraint that Germanus wascoming, insomuch, that one Elaﬁus, the chief of thatreligion, hastened to meet the holy men, without havingreceived any certain news, carrying with him his son, wholaboured under a weakness of his limbs in the very ﬂowerof his youth ; for the nerves being withered, his leg wasso contracted that the limb was useless, and he could notwalk. All the country followed this Elaﬁus. The priestsarrived, and were met by the ignorant multitude, whomthey blessed, and preached the word of God to them.They found the people constant in the faith as they hadleft them; and learning that but few had gone astraythey found out the authors, and condemned them. ThenElaﬁus cast himself at the feet of the priests, presentinghis son, whose distress was visible, and needed no wordst’express it. All were grieved, but especially the priests,who put up their prayers for him before the throne ofmercy; and Germanus, causing the youth to sit down,</p>

The multitudewas amazed at the miracle, and the Catholic faith wasﬁrmly planted in the minds of all; after which, theywere, in a. sermon, warned and exhorted to make amendsfor their errors. By the judgment of all, the Spreadersof the heresy, who had been expelled the island, werebrought before the priests, to be conveyed up into thecontinent, that the country might be rid of them, andthey corrected of their errors. Thus the faith in thoseparts continued long after pure and untainted. Allthings being settled, the blessed prelates returned homeas prosperously as they came.But Germanus, after this, went to Ravenna to inter- The bishopscede for the tranquillity of the Americans, where, being W" d'pm'very honourably received by Valentinian and his mother,Placidia, he departed to Christ; his body was conveyedto his own city with a splendid retinue, and numberlessdeeds of charity accompanied him to the grave.

Among other most wickedactions, not to be-expræsed, which their own historian,Gildas, moumfully takes notice of, they added this—thatthey never preached the faith to the Saxons, or English,who dwelt amongst them; however, the goodness of Goddid not forsake his people, whom he foreknew, but sentto the aforesaid nation much more worthy preachers, tobring it to the faith.CHAP.

In short,they sent back Augustine, whom he had appointed to beconsecrated bishop, in case they were received by theEnglish, that he might, by humble entreaty, obtain ofthe holy Gregory, that they should not be compelled toundertake so dangerous, toilsome, and uncertain at journey. The pope, in reply, sent them a hortatory epistle,persuading them to proceed in the work of the Divineword, and rely on the assistance of the Almighty. Thepurport of which letter was as follows :—“ Gregory, the servant of the servants of God, to the ﬁggry'lservants of our Lord.

' 'rived in Britain. The powerful Ethelbert was at thattime king of Kent; he had extended his dominions asfar as the great river Humber, by which the SouthernSaxons are divided from the Northern. On the east ofKent is the large Isle of Thanet, containing, accordingto the English way of reckoning, 600 families, dividedfrom the other land by the river Wantsum, which isabout three furlongs over, and fordable only in twoplaces, for both ends of it run into the sea. In thisisland landed the servant of our Lord, Augustine, andhis companions, being, as is reported, nearly forty men.They had, by order of the blessed Pope Gregory, takeninterpreters of the nation of the Franks, and sendingto Ethelbert, signiﬁed that they were come from Rome,and brought a. joyful message, which most undoubtedlyassured to all that took advantage of it everlasting joysin heaven, and a kingdom that would never end, withthe living and true God. The king, having heard this,ordered them to stay in that island where they hadlanded, and that they should be furnished with all necessaries, till he should consider what to do with them.For he had before heard of the Christian religion,having a Christian wife of the royal family of theFranks, called Bertha; whom he had received from herparents, upon condition that she should be permittedto practise her religion with the Bishop Luidhard, whowas sent with her to preserve her faith. Some daysafter, the king came into the island, and sitting in the' G</p>

For he had taken precautionthat they should not come to him in any house, lest,according to an ancient superstition, if they practisedany magical arts, they might impose upon him, and soget the better of him. But they came furnished WithDivine, not with magic virtue, bearing a silver cross fortheir banner, and the image of our Lord and Saviourpainted on a. board; and singing the litany, they offeredup their prayers to the Lord for the eternal salvationboth of themselves and of those to whom they werecome. When he had sat down, pursuant to the king’scommands, and preached to him and his attendantsthere present, the word of life, the king answeredthus:——“ Your words and promises are very fair, butas they are new to us, and of uncertain import, I cannotapprove of them so far as to forsake that which I haveso long followed With the whole English nation. Butbecause you are come from far into my kingdom, and,as I conceive, are desirous to impart to us those thingswhich you believe to be true, and most beneficia], wewill not molest you, but give you favourable enter—tainment, and take care to supply you with your necessary sustenance; nor do we forbid you to preach andgain as many as you can to your religion.” Accordinglyhe permitted them to reside in the city of Canterbury,which was the metropolis of all his dominions, and,pursuant to his promise, besides allowing them sustenance, did not refuse them liberty to preach. It isreported that, as they drew near to the city, after theirmanner, with the holy cross, and the image of oursovereign Lord and King, J esus Christ, they, in concert,sung this litany: “ We beseech thee, O_Lord, in all thymercy, that thy anger and wrath be turned away fromthis city, and from thy holy house, because we havesinned.

Inshort, several believed and were baptized, admiring thesimplicity of their innocent life, and the sweetness oftheir heavenly doctrine. There was on the east side ofthe city, a church dedicated to the honour of St. Martin,built whilst the Romans were still in the island, whereinthe queen, who, as has been said before, was a Christian,used to pray. In this they ﬁrst began to meet, to sing,to pray, to say mass, to preach, and to baptize, till theking, being converted to the faith, allowed them topreach openly, and build or repair churches in all places.When he, among the rest, induced by the unspotted life of these holy men, and their delightfulpromises, which, by many miracles, they proved to bemost certain, believed and was baptized, greater numbers began daily to ﬂock together to hear the word, and,forsaking their heathen rites, to associate themselves, bybelieving, t0 the unity of the church of Christ.

AUGUSTINE, BEING MADE BISHOP,SENDS TO ACQUAINT POPE GREGORY WITH WHAT HADBEEN DONE, AND RECEIVES His ANSWER TO THE DOUBTSHE HAD PROPOSED T0 HIM.IN the meantime, Augustine, the man of God, repaired St- Augustlne'a questo Arles, and, pursuant to the orders received from the 33:30:]:holy Father Gregory, was ordained archbishop of the 2323?English nation, by fEtherius, archbishop of that city.Then returning into Britain, he sent Laurentius, thepriest, and Peter, the monk, to Rome, to acquaint PopeGregory, that the nation of the English had receivedthe faith of Christ, and that he was himself made theirbishop. At the same time, he desired his solution ofsome doubts that occurred to him. He soon receivedproper answers to his questions, which we have alsothought ﬁt to insert in this our history :—The First Question of Augustine, Bishop of theChurch of Canterbury.——Concerning bishops, how theyare to behave themselves towards their clergy? or intohow many portions the things given by the faithful tothe altar are to be divided? and how the bishop is to actin the church?Gregory, Pope of the City of Rome, answers.—-HolyWrit, which no doubt you are well versed in, testiﬁes,andvparticularly St. Paul’s Epistle to Timothy, whereinhe endeavours to instruct him how he should behavehimself in the house of God ; but it is the custom of theapostolic. see to prescribe rules to bishops newly ordained,that all emoluments which accrue, are to be divided into</p>

Quia et de eisdem partibus, de quibus præfati sumus, novimus scriptum quoddividebatur singulis prout cuique opus erat. De eorumquoque stipendio cogitandum atque providendum est, etsub ecclesiastica regula sunt tenendi, ut bonis moribusvivant, et cauendis psalmis invigilent, et ab omnibusillicitis et cor et linguam et corpus, Deo auctore, conservent. Communi autem vita viventibus jam de faciendis portionibus, vel exhibenda hospitalitate et adimplenda misericordia, nobis quid erit loquendum, cumomne quod superest in causis piis ac religiosis erogandum est? Domino omnium magistro docente, [Luc. xi.M,] Quod superest, date eleemosynam, et ecce omniamunda sunt vobis.Secunda Interrogatio Augustini.—Cum una. sit ﬁdes,cur sunt ecclesiarum diversæ consuetudines, et altera,consuetudo missarum in sancta. Romana ecclesia atquealtera in Galliarum tenetur?Respondit Gregorius Papa.—Novit fraternitas tua Romanæ ecclesiæ consuetudinem, in qua. se meminit nutritam.Sed mihi placet, sive in Romana., sive in Galliarum, seu in</p>

But in regard that you, my brother, being brought up under monastic rules, are not tolive apart from your clergy in the English chui'ch,which, by God‘s assistance, has been lately brought tothe faith; you are to follow that course of life which ourforefathers did in the time of the primitive church, whennone of them said anything that he possessed was hisown, but all things were in common among them.But if there are any clerks not received into holyorders, who cannot live continent, they are to take wives,and receive their stipends abroad; because we know it iswritten, that out of the same portions above-mentioneda distribution was made to each of them according toevery one’s wants. Care is also to be taken of theirstipends, and provision to be made, and they are to bekept under ecclesiastical rules, that they may live orderly, and attend to singing of psalms, and by the helpof God, preserve their hearts, and tongues, and bodiesfrom all that is unlawful. But as for those that live incommon, why need we say anything of making portions,or keeping hospitality and exhibiting mercy? inasmuchas all that can be spared is to be spent in pious and religious works, according to the commands of Him who isthe Lord and Master of all, “ Give alms of such thingsas you have, and behold all things are clean unto you.”Augustine’s Second Question.—Whereas the faith isone and the same, why are there different customs indiﬁ'erent churches? and why is one custom of massesobserved in the holy Roman church, and another in theGallicam church ?Pope Gregory answers.—You know, my brother, thecustom of the Roman church in which you rememberyou were bred up. But it pleases me, that if you havefound anything, either in the Roman, or the Gallic'an,</p>

Suntenim quidam, qui habentes subsidia. furtum perpetrant,et sunt alii, qui hac in re ex inopia delinquunt; undenecesse est ut quidam damnis, quidam vero verberibus,et quidam districtius, quidam autem levius, corrigantur.Et cum paulo districtius agitur, ex caritate agendum estet non ex furore, quia ipsi hoc præstatur qui corrigitur,ne gehennæ ignibus tradatur. Sic enim nos ﬁdelibustenere disciplinam debemus, sicut boni patres carnalibusfiliis solent, quos et pro culpis verberibus feriunt, et tamenipsos, quos doloribus afﬂigunt, habere heredes quærunt;et quæ possident ipsis servant, quos irati insequi videntur.Hæc ergo caritas in mente tenenda. est, et ipsa modumcorreptionis dictat, ita ut mens extra rationis regulamomnino nihil faciat. Addes etiam, quomodo ea, quæfurtu de ecclesiis abstulerint, reddere debeant; sed absitut ecclesia cum augmento recipiat quod de terrenis rebusvidetur amittere, et lucra de vanis quærere.Quarta Interrogatio Augustini.—-Si debeant duo ger</p>
          <p>or any other church, which may be more acceptable to AzD. 597.Almighty God, you carefully make choice of the same,and sedulously teach the church of the English, whichas yet is new in the faith, whatsoever you can gatherfrom the several churches. For things are not to beloved for the sake of places, but places for the sake ofgood things. Choose, therefore, from every churchthose things that are pious, religious, and upright, andwhen you have, as it were, made them up into one body,let the minds of the English be accustomed thereto.Augustine's Third Question.—I beseech you to informme, what punishment must be inﬂicted, if any one shalltake any thing by stealth from the church?Gregory answers.——You may judge, my brother, bythe person of the thief, in what manner he is to be corrected. For there are some, who, having substance,commit theft; and there are others, who trangress inthis point through want. Wherefore it is requisite, thatsome be punished in their purses, others with stripes;some with more severity, and some more mildly. Andwhen the severity is more, it is to proceed from charity,not from passion; because this is done to him who iscorrected, that he may not be delivered up to hell—ﬁre.For it behoves us to maintain discipline among thefaithful, as good parents do with their carnal children,. whom they punish with stripes for their faults, and yetdesign to make those their heirs whom they chastise;and they preserve what they possess for those whomthey seem in anger to persecute. This charity is, therefore, to be kept in mind, and it dictates the measure ofthe punishment, so that the mind may do nothingbeyond the rule of reason. You may add, that they areto restore those things which they have stolen from thechurch. But, God forbid, that the church should makeproﬁt from those earthly things which it seems to lose,or seek gain out of such vanities.Augustine's F ourth Question.—Whether two brothers</p>
          <p>' mani fratres singulas sorores accipere, quæ sunt ab illislonga progenie generatæ?'Respondit Gregorius.—-Hoc fieri modis omnibus licet;nequaquam enim in sacris eloquiis invenitur, quod huiccapitulo contradicere videatur.Quinta Interrogatio Augustini.—Usque ad quotamgenerationem fideles debeant cum propinquis sibi conjugio copulari? et novercis et cognatis si liceat; copulariconjugio? 'Respondit Gregorius.-—Q,uædam terrena lex in Romana republica permittit ut, sive fratris et sororis, seuduorum fratrum germanorum, vel duarum sororum, filiuset filia. misceantur; sed experimento didicimus ex taliconjugio sobolem non posse succrescere, et Sacra. Lexprohibet cognationis turpitudinem revelare. Unde necesse est ut jam tertia vel quarta. generatio fideliumlicenter sibi jungi debeat; nam secunda, quam prædix—imus, a se omni modo debet abstinere. Cum novercaautem miscere grave est facinus, quia et in Lege scriptum est, [Lev. xviii. 7,] Turpitudinem patris tui nonrevelabis. Neque enim patris turpitudinem filius revelare potest; sed, quia scriptum est, [Gen. ii. 24,] Eran;duo in carne una, qui turpitudinem novercæ, quæ unacaro cum patre fuit, revelare præsumserit, profectopatris turpitudinem revelavit. Cum cognata quoquemiscere prohibitum est, quia per conjunctionem prioremcaro fratris fuerat facta. Pro qua. re etiam J ohannesBaptista capite truncatus est et sancto martyrio consummatus, cui non est dictum ut Christum negaret, etpro Christi confessione occisus est; sed quia idemDominus noster Jesus Christus dixerat, [Jo. xiv. 6,]Ego sum veritas, quia pro veritate J ohannes occisus est,videlicet et pro Christo sanguinem fudit.Quia .vero sunt multi in Anglorum gente qui, dumadhuc in infidelitate essent, huic nefando conjugio dicuntur admixti, ad ﬁdem venientes admonendi sunt ut se</p>
          <p>may marry two sisters, which are of a family far removed A.D. 597.from them?Gregory answers.—This may lawfully be done; fornothing is found in holy writ that seems to contradict it.Augustine's F ift]! Question.—-——To what degree may thefaithful marry with their kindred? and whether it islawful for men to marry their stepmothers and relations?Gregory answers.-—-A certain worldly law in the Romancommonwealth allows, that the son and daughter of abrother and sister, or of two brothers, or two sisters, maybe joined in matrimony; but we have found by experience, that no offspring can come of such wedlock; andthe Divine Law forbids a man “ to uncover the nakednessof his kindred.” Hence of necessity it must be the thirdor fourth generation of the faithful, that can be lawfullyjoined in matrimony; for the second, which we havementioned, must altogether abstain from one another.To marry with one’s stepmother is a heinous crime, because it is written in the Law, “ Thou shalt not uncoverthe nakedness of thy f'ather?1 now the son, indeed, cannotuncover his father's nakedness; but in regard that it iswritten, “ They shall be two in one ﬂesh,” he that presumesto uncover the nakedness of his stepmother, who wasone ﬂesh with his father, certainly uncovers the nakedness of his father. It is also prohibited to marry with asister—in—Iaw, because by the former union she is becomethe brother’s ﬂesh. For which thing also J ohn the Baptist was beheaded and ended his life in holy martyrdom.For though he was not ordered to deny Christ, and in- deed was killed for confessing Christ, yet in regard thatthe same J esus Christ, our Lord, said, “ I am the Truth,”because J ohn was killed for the truth, he also shed hisblood for Christ. 'But forasmuch as there are many of the English, who,Whilst they were still in inﬁdelity, are said to have beenjoined in this execrable matrimony, when they cometothe faith they are to be admonished to abstain, and be</p>

Non tamenpro hac re sacri corporis ac sanguinis Domini communioneprivandi sunt, ne in eis illa. ulcisci videantur, in quibusse per ignorantiam ante lavacrum baptismatis adstrinxerunt. In hoc enim tempore sancta. ecclesia quædam perfervorem corrigit, quædam per mansuetudinem tolerat,quædam per considerationem dissimulat, atque ita portatet dissimulat ut sæpe malum, quod adversatur, portandoet dissimulando compescat. Omnes autem qui ad ﬁdemveniunt admonendi sunt, ne tale aliquid audeant perpetrare.

Sed fraternitatem tuam ita volumusepiscopos ordinare, ut ipsi sibi episcopi longo intervallominime disjungantur; quatenus nulla sit necessitas ut, inordinatione episcopi, alii convenire non possint; pastoresquoque, quorum præsentia valde est utilis, facile debeantconvenire. Cum igitur, auctore Deo, ita fuerint episcopiin propinquis sibi locis ordinati, per omnia. episcoporumordinatio, sine aggregatis tribus vel quatuor episcopis,fieri non debet. Nam in ipsis rebus spiritualibus, ut</p>

Let them fear A.D. 597.the dreadful judgment of God, lest, for the gratiﬁca—tion of their carnal appetites, they incur the tormentsof eternal punishment. Yet they are not on thisaccount to be deprived of the communion of the bodyand blood of Christ, lest they seem to be punished forthose things which they did through ignorance beforethey had received baptism. For at this time the HolyChurch chastises some things through zeal, and toleratessome through meekness, and connives at some thingsthrough discretion, that so she may often, by this forbearance and connivance, suppress the evil which shedisapproves. But all that come to the faith, are to beadmonished not to do such things. And if any shall beguilty of them, they are to be excluded from the communion of the body and blood of Christ. For as the offenceis, in some measure, to be tolerated in those who did itthrough ignorance, so it is to be strenuously prosecutedin those who do not fear to sin knowingly. .;Augustine's Sixth Question.——Whether a bishop maybe ordained without other bishops being present, in casethere be so great a distance between them, that theycannot easily come together?Gregory answers.——As for the church of England, inwhich you are as yet the only bishop, you can no otherwise ordain a bishop than in the absence of other bishops;unless some bishops should come over from Gaul, thatthey may be present as witnesses to you in ordaining abishop. But we would have you, my brother, to ordainbishops in such a manner, that the said bishops may notbe far asunder, that when a new bishop is to be ordained,there be no difﬁculty, but that other bishops, and pastorsalso, whose presence is necessary, may easily come together. Thus, when, by the help of God, bishops shall be soconstituted in places everywhere near to one another,no ordination of a bishop is to he performed without assembling three or four bishops. For, even in spiritual</p>

Cur non ergo et inhac spirituali ordinatione, qua. per sacrum ministeriumhomo Deo conjungitur, tales conveniant, qui vel in provectu ordinati episcopi gaudeant, vel pro ejus custodia.omnipotenti Deo preces pariter fundant?Septima Interrogatio Augustini.—Qualiter debemuscum Galliarum Britanniarumque episcopis agere ?Respondit Gregorius.—In Galliarum episcopis nullamtibi auctoritatem tribuimus; quia ab antiquis prædecessorum meorum temporibus pallium Arelatensis episcopus accepit, quem nos privare auctoritate perceptaminime debemus. Si igitur contingat ut fraternitas tuaad Galliarum provinciam transeat, cum eodem Arelatensiepiscopo debet agere qualiter, si qua sunt in episcopisvitia., corrigantur; qui, si forte in disciplinæ vigoretepidus exsistat, tuæ fraternitatis zelo accendendus est;cui etiam epistolas fecimun, ut cum tuæ sanctitatis præsentia in Galliis, et ipse tota. mente subveniat, et quæsunt Creatoris nostri jussioni contraria, ab episcoporummoribus compescat.

          <p>' aﬂ'airs, we may take example by the temporal, that they A.D. 597.may be wisely and discreetly conducted. It is certain, thatwhen marriages are celebrated in the world, some married persons are assembled, that those who went beforein the way of matrimony, may also partake in the joy ofthe succeeding couple. Why, then, at this spiritual ordination, wherein, by means of the sacred ministry, manis joined to God, should not such persons be assembled,as may either rejoice in the advancement of the newbishop, or jointly pour forth their prayers to AhnightyGod for his preservation?Augustine's Seventh Question.—How are we to dealwith the bishops of France and Britain?Gregory answers.—We give you no authority overthe bishops of France, because the bishop of Arleereceived the pall in ancient times from my predecessor,and we are not to deprive him of the authority he hasreceived. If it shall therefore happen, my brother,that you go over into the province of France, you areto concert with the said bishop of Arlee, how, if therebe any faults among the bishops, they may be amended.And if he shall be lukewarm in keeping up discipline,he is to be corrected by your zeal; to whom we havealso written, that when your holiness shall be in France,he may also use all his endeavours to assist you, and putaway from the behaviour of the bishops a.]l that shallbe opposite to the command of our Creator. But youof your own authority shall not have power to judge thebishops of France, but by persuading, soothing, andshowing good works for"them to imitate; you shallreform the minds of wicked men to the pursuit of holiness; for it is written in the Law, “ When thou comestinto the standing corn of thy neighbours, then thoumayest pluck the ears with thine hand; þut thou shaltnot move a. sickle unto thy neighbour’s standing corn.”For thou mayest not apply the sickle of judgment inthat harvest, which seems to have been committed toH</p>

Quæomnia rudi Anglorum genti oportet haberi comperta.Respondit Gregorius.—Hoc non ambigo fraternitatemtuam esse requisitam, cui jam et responsum reddidisseme arbitror; sed hoc, quod ipse dicere et sentire potuisti, credo quod mea apud te volueris responsione ﬁrmari.Mulier etenim prægnans cur non debeat baptizari, cumnon sit ante omnipotentis Dei oculos culpa aliquafecunditas carnis? Nam cum primi parentes nostri inParadiso deliquissent, immortalitatem, quam acceperant,recto Dei judicio perdiderunt.

But whatsoever is to be done by authority,must be transacted with the aforesaid bishop of Arles,lest that should be omitted, which the ancient institutionof the fathers has appointed. But as for all the bishopsof Britain, we commit them to your care, that theunlearned may be taught, the weak strengthened bypersuasion, and the perverse corrected by authority.Augustine's Eighth Question.—Whether a. womanwith child ought to be baptized? Or how long after shehas brought forth, may she come into the church? Asalso, after how many days the infant born may bebaptized, lest he be prevented by death? Or how longafter her husband may have carnal knowledge of her?Or whether it be lawful for her to come into the churchwhen she has her courses? Or to receive the holysacrament of communion? Or whether a man, undercertain circumstances, may come into the church beforehe has washed with water? Or approach to receivethe mystery of the holy communion? All which thingsare requisite to be known by the rude nation of theEnglish.Gregory answers.-I do not doubt but that thesequestions have been put to you, my brother, and I thinkI have already answered you therein. But I believeyou would wish the opinion which you yourself mightgive to be conﬁrmed by mine also. Why should not awoman with child be baptized, since the fruitfulness ofthe ﬂesh is no oﬂ'ence in the eyes of Almighty God?For when our ﬁrst parents sinned in Paradise, theyforfeited the immortality which they had received, bythe just judgment of God. Because, therefore, Almighty God would not for their fault whollydestroy thehuman race, he both deprived man of immortality forhis sin, and, at the same time, of his great goodness,H 2</p>
          <p>fecunditatem ei sobolis reservavit. Quod ergo naturæhumanæ ex omnipotentis Dei dono servatum est, quaratione poterit. a sacri baptismatis gratia prohiberi? Inillo quippe mysterio, in quo omnis culpa funditus exstinguitur, valde stultum est, si donum gratiæ contradicereposse videatur.Cum vero enixa fuerit mulier, post quot. dies debeatecclesiam intrare, Testamenti Veteris præceptione didicisti, ut. pro masculo diebus triginta tribus, pro feminaautem diebus sexaginta sex, debeat abstinere. Quodtamen sciendum est, quia. in mysterio accipitur. Namsi hora eadem, qua genuerit, actura gratias intret ecclesiam, nullo peccati pondere gravatur; voluptas etenimcarnis, non dolor, in culpa est. In carnis autem commixtione voluptas est, nam in prolis prolatione gemitus.Unde et ipsi primæ matri omnium dicitur, [Gen. iii. 16,]In doloribus paries; si itaque enixam mulierem prohibemus ecclesiam intrare, ipsam ei poenam suam inculpam deputamus. Baptimre autem vel enixam mulierem, vel hoc quod genuerit,, si mortis periculo urgetur,vel ipsam hora. eadem qua gignit, vel hoc quod gignitur,eadem qua natum est, nullo modo prohibetur; quia.sancti mysterii gratia, sicut viventibus atque discernentibus, cum magna discretione providenda est, ita. his,quibus mors imminet, sine ulla dilatione offerenda; ne,dum adhuc tempus ad præbendum redemtionis mysteriumquæritur, interveniente paululum mora., inveniri nonvaleat, qui redimatur.Ad ejus vero concubitum vir suus accedere non debetquoadusque, qui gignitur, ablactetur. Prava autem inconjugatorum moribus consuetudo surrexit, ut mulieresfilios, quos gignunt, nutrire contemnant, eosque aliismulieribus ad nutriendum tradant, quod, videlicet, exsola causa incontinentiæ videtur inventum, quia, dumse continere nolunt, despiciunt lactare quos gignunt.</p>
          <p>reserved to him the power of propagating his race after A.D. 597.him. On what account then can that which is preservedto the human race, by the free gift of Almighty God,be excluded from the privilege of baptism? For it isvery foolish to imagine that the gift of grace opposesthat mystery in which all sin is blotted out. When awoman is delivered, after how many days she may comeinto the church, you have been informed by reading theOld Testament, viz. that she is to abstain for a malechild thirty-three days, and sixty-six for a female. Nowyou must know that this is to be taken in a mystery;for if she enters the church the very hour that she isdelivered, to return thanks, she is not guilty of any sin ;because the pleasure of the ﬂesh is in fault, and not thepain; but the pleasure is in the copulation of the ﬂesh,whereas there is pain in bringing forth the child.Wherefore it is said to the ﬁrst mother of all, “ In sorrowshalt thou bring forth children.” If, therefore, we forbida woman that has brought forth, to enter the church,we make a crime of her very punishment. To baptizeeither a woman who has brought forth, if there bedanger of death, even the very hour that she bringsforth, or that which she has brought forth the very hourit is born, is in no way prohibited, because, as the graceof the holy mystery is to be with much discretion provided for the living and understanding, so is it to bewithout any delay offered to the dying; lest, while afurther time is sought to confer the mystery of redemption, a small delay intervening, the person that isto be redeemed is dead and gone.Her husband is not to approach her, till the infantborn be weaned. A bad custom is sprung up in thebehaviour of married people, that is, that women disdainto suckle the children which they bring forth, andgive them to other women to suckle; which seems tohave been invented on no other account but incontinency; because, as they will not be continent, they</p>
          <p>Hæ itaque, quæ ﬁlios suos ex prava consuetudine aliisad nutriendum tradunt, nisi purgationis tempus transierit, viris suis non debent admisceri; quippe qui et sinepartus causa, cum in suetis menstruis detinentur, virissuis misceri prohibentur, ita ut morte Lex sacra feriatsi quis vir ad menstruatam mulierem accedat. Quætamen mulier, dum consuetudinem menstruam patitur,prohiberi ecclesiam intrare non debet, quia ei naturæsuperﬂuitas in culpam non valet reputari; et per hoc,quod invita patitur, justum non est ut ingressu ecclesiæprivetur. Novimus namque quod mulier, quæ fluxumpatiebatur sanguinis, post tergum Domini humiliterveniens vestimenti ejus fimbriam tetigit, atque ab eastatim sua infirmitas recessit. Si ergo in fluxu sanguinis posita, laudabiliter potuit Domini vestimentumtangere, cur, quæ menstruam sanguinis patitur, ei nonliceat Domini ecclesiam intrare? Sed dicis, Illaminfirmitas compulit; has vero, de quibus loquimur, consuetudo constringit. Perpende autem, frater carissime,quia. omne, quod in hac mortali carne patimur ex inﬁrmitate naturæ, est digno Dei judicio post, culpam ordinatum; esurire namque, sitire, æstuare, algere, lassescere, ex infirmitate naturæ est; et quid est aliud contra.famem alimenta, contra sitim potum, contra æstumauras, contra. frigus vestem, contra lassitudinem requiem,quærere, nisi medicamentum quoddam contra ægritudines explorare? Feminæ itaque et menstruus suisanguinis ﬂuxus ægritudo est. Si igitur bene praesumsit,quæ vestimentum Domini in languore posita tetigit,quod uni personæ infirmanti conceditur, cur non concedatur cunctis mulieribus, quæ naturæ suæ vitio inﬁrmantur?“ Sanctæ autem communionis mysterium in eisdem</p>
          <p>Will not suckle the children which they bear. Those A.D.597.women, therefore, who, from bad custom, give theirchildren to others to bring up, must not approach theirhusbands till the time of puriﬁcation is past. For evenwhen there has been no child—birth, women are forbidden to do so, whilst they have their monthly courses,insomuch that the Law condemns to death any man thatshall approach unto a woman during her uncleanness.Yet the woman, nevertheless, must not be forbidden tocome into the church whilst she has her monthly courses;because the superﬂuity of nature cannot be imputed toher as a. crime; and it is not just that she should berefused admittance into the church, for that which shesuffers against her will. For we know, that the womanwho had the issue of blood, humbly approaching behindour Lord’s back, touched the hem of his garment, andher distemper immediately departed from her. If,therefore, she that had an issue of blood might commendably touch the garment of our Lord, why may notshe, who has the monthly courses, lawfully enter intothe church of God? But you may say, Her distempercompelled her, whereas these we speak of are bound bycustom. Consider then, most dear brother, that all wesuffer in this mortal ﬂesh, through the inﬁrmity of ournature, is ordained by the just judgment of God afterthe fall; for to hunger, to thirst, to be hot, to be cold,to be weary, is from the inﬁrmity of our nature; andwhat else is it to seek food against hunger, drink againstthirst, air against heat, clothes against cold, rest againstweariness, than to procure a remedy against distempers?Thus to a woman her monthly courses are a distemper.If, therefore, it was a commendable boldness in her,Who in her disease touched our Lord‘s garment, whymay not that which is allowed to one inﬁrm person, begranted to all women, who, through the fault of theirnature, are distempered?She must not, therefore, be forbidden to receive the</p>

          <p>mystery of the holy communion during those days. But A.D. 597,if any one out of profound respect does not presume todo it, she is to be commended; yet if she receives it,she is not to be judged. For it is the part of nobleminds in some manner to acknowledge their faults, evenwhere there is no oﬂ'ence; because very often that isdone without a fault, which, nevertheless, proceededfrom a. fault. Therefore, when we are hungry, it is nocrime to eat; yet our being hungry proceeds from thesin of the ﬁrst man. The monthly courses are no crimein women, because they naturally happen; however, because our nature itself is so depraved, that it appears tobe so without the concurrence of the will, the fault proceeds from sin, and thereby human nature may herselfknow what she is become by judgment. And let man,who wilfully committed the oﬂ'ence, bear the guilt of thatoﬁ'ence. And, therefore, let women consider with themselves, and if they do not presume, during their monthlycourses, to approach the sacrament of the body andblood of our Lord, they are to be commended for theirpraiseworthy consideration; but when they are carriedaway with love of the same mystery to receive it out ofthe usual custom of religious life, they are not to berestrained, as we said before. For as in the Old Testament the outward works are observed, so in the NewTestament, that which is outwardly done, is not so diligently regarded as that which is inwardly thought, inorder to punish it by a discerning judgment. ForWhereas the Law forbids the eating of many things asunclean, yet our Lord says in the Gospel, “ Not thatwhich goeth into the mouth deﬁleth a man; but thatwhich cometh out of the mouth, this deﬁleth a man."And presently after he added, expounding the same,“ Out of the heart proceedeth evil thoughts.” Whereit is insufﬁciently shown, that that is declared by Almighty God to be polluted in fact, which proceeds fromthe root of a polluted thought. Whence also Paul the</p>
          <p>Paulus quoque apostolus dicit, [Tit. i. 15,] Omnia‘mundamundis, coinquinatis autem et infidelibus nihil est mundum; atque mox ejusdem causam coinquinationis annuncians subjungit, Coinquinata sunt enim et menseorum et conscientia. Si ergo ei cibus immundus nonest, cui mens immunda non fuerit, cur, quod mundamente mulier ex natura. patitur ei in immunditiam reputetur?Vir autem cum propria. conjuge dormiens, nisi lotusaqua, intrare ecclesiam non debet; sed neque lotusintrare statim debet. Lex autem veteri populo præcepit, ut mixtus vir mulieri et lavari aqua debeat, etante solis occasum ecclesiam non intrare;. quod tamenintelligi spiritualiter potest. Quia mulieri vir miscetur,quando illicitæ concupiscentiæ animus in cogitatione perdelectationem conjungitur; quia, nisi prius ignis concupiscentiæ a mente deferveat, dignum se congregationifratrum æstimare non debet, qui se gravari per nequitiam pravæ voluntatis videt. Quamvis de hac rediversæ hominum nationes diversa. sentiant, atque aliacustodire videantur, Romanorum tamen semper ab antiquioribus usus fuit, post admixtionem propriæ conjugis,et lavacri purificationem quærere, et ab ingressu ecclesiæ paululum reverenter abstinere. Nec hæc dicentesculpam deputamus esse conjugium, sed quia ipsa. licita.admixtio conjugis sine voluptate carnis ﬁeri non potest,a sacri loci ingressu abstinendum est, quia. voluptas ipaesse sine culpa nullatenus potest. Non enim de adulterio, vel fornicatione, sed de legitimo conjugio natusfuerat, qui dicebat, [Ps. i. 6,] Ecce enim in iniquitatibusconceptus sum, et in peccatis concepit me mater mea.Qui enim in iniquitatibus conceptum se noverat, a delictose natum gemebat; quia portat arbor in ramo humoremvitii, quem traxit ex radice. In quibus tamen verbisnon admixtionem conjugum iniquitatem nominat, sed</p>
          <p>Apostle says, “ Unto the pure all things are pure, but A.D. 597.unto them that are deﬁled and unbelieving, nothing ispure.” And presently after, declaring the cause of thatdeﬁlement, he adds, “ For even their mind and conscience is deﬁled.” If, therefore, meat is not uncleanto him who has a clean mind, why shall that which aclean woman suffers according to nature, be imputed toher as uncleanness ?A man who has approached his own wife is not toenter the church unless washed with water, nor is he toenter immediately although washed. The Law prescribedto the ancient people, that a man in such cases shouldbe washed with water, and not enter into the churchbefore the setting of the sun. Which, nevertheless,may be understood spiritually, because a man acts sowhen the mind is led by the imagination to unlawfulconcupiscence; for unless the ﬁre of concupiscence beﬁrst driven from his mind, he is not to think himselfworthy of the congregation of the brethren, whilst hethus indulges an unlawful passion. For though severalnations have diﬁ'erent opinions concerning this affair,and seem to observe different rules, it was always thecustom of the Romans from ancient times, for such anone to be cleansed by washing, and for some timerespectfully to forbear entering the church. N or do we,in so saying, assign matrimony to be a fault ; but forasmuch as lawful intercourse cannot be had without thepleasure of the ﬂesh, it is proper to forbear entering theholy place, because the pleasure itself cannot be withouta fault. For he was not born of adultery or fornication,but of lawful marriage, who said, “ Behold I was conceived in iniquity, and in sin my mother brought mefort .” For he who knew himself to have been conceived in iniquity, lamented that he was born from sin,because the tree in its bough bears the moisture it drewfrom the root. In which words, however, he does notcall the union of the married couple iniquity, but the</p>
          <p>ipsam, videlicet, voluptatem admixtionis. Sunt, etenimmulta, quæ licita probantur esse ac legitima, et tamenin eorum actu aliquatenus foedamur; sicut sæpe irascendo culpas insequimur, et tranquillitatem in nobisanimi perturbamus; et cum rectum sit quod agitur, nonest tamen approbabile quod in eo animus perturbatur.Contra vitia quippe delinquentium iratus fuerat, quidicebat, [Ps. vi. 7,] Turbatus est præ ira oculus meus;quia. enim non valet nisi tranquilla mens in contemplationis se lucem suspendere, in ira suum oculum turbatum dolebat; quia, dum male acta deorsum insequitur,confundi atque turbari a summorum contemplationecogebatur. Et laudabilis ergo est ira. contra vitium,et tamen molesta., qua turbatum se aliquem reatum incurrisse æstimat. Oportet itaque legitimam carnis copulam, ut causa prolis sit, non voluptatis; et carniscommixtio creandorum liberorum sit gratia, non satisfactio vitiorum. Si quis vero sua conjuge, non cupidinevoluptatis raptus, sed solummodo creandorum liberorumgratia, utitur, iste profecto sive de ingressu ecclesiæ,seu de sumendo Dominici corporis sanguinisque mysterio,suo est judicio relinquendus; quia a. nobis prohiberi nondebet accipere, qui in igne positus nescit ardere. Cumvero non amor procreandæ sobolis, sed voluptas dominatur in opere commixtionis, habent conjuges etiam desua commixtione quod deﬂeant. Hoc enim eis conceditsancta prædicatio; et tamen de ipsa. concessione metuanimum concutit. Nam cum Paulus apostolus diceret,[1 Cor. vii. 9, 6,] Qui se continere non potest, habeatuxorem suam, statim subjungere curavit, Hoc autemdico secundum indulgentiam, non secundum imperium.Non enim indulgetur quod licet, quia. justum est; quodigitur indulgere dixit, culpam esse demonstravit.Vigilanti vero mente pensandum est, quod in Sina.monte Dominus ad populum locuturus prius eundem</p>
          <p>pleasure of the copulation. For there are many things A.D. 597.which are proved to be lawful, and yet we are somewhatdeﬁled in doing them. As very often by being angry wecorrect faults, and at the same time disturb our ownpeace of mindi and though that which we do is right,yet it is not to be approved that our mind should be discomposed. For he who said, “ My eye was disturbedwith anger,” had been angry at the vices of those whohad oﬁ'ended. Now, in regard that only a sedate mindcan apply itself to contemplation, he grieved that hiseye was disturbed with anger; because, whilst he'wascorrecting evil actions below, he was obliged to be withdrawn and disturbed from the contemplation of thingsabove. Anger against vice is, therefore, commendable,and yet painful to a man, because he thinks that by hismind being agitated, he has incurred some guilt. Lawfulcommerce, therefore, must be for the sake of children,not of pleasure; and must be to procure oﬁ'spring, notto satisfy vices. But if any man is led not by the desireof pleasure, but only for the sake of getting children,such a man is certainly to be left to his own judgment,either as to entering the church, or as to receiving themystery of the body and blood of our Lord, which he,who being placed in the ﬁre cannot burn, is not to beforbidden by us to receive. But when, not the love ofgetting children, but of pleasure prevails, the pair havecause to lament their deed. For this the holy preaching allows them, and yet ﬁlls the mind with dread of thevery allowance. For when Paul the Apostle said, “ Lethim that cannot contain, have his wife ;” he presentlytook care to subjoin, “ But this I say by way of indulgence, not by way of command." For that is notgranted by way of indulgence which is lawful, because itis just; and, therefore, that which he said he indulged,he showed to be an offence.It is seriously to be considered, that when God was tospeak to the people on Mount Sinai, he ﬁrst commanded</p>

Hinc etenim ad David de pueris suis persacerdotem dicitur, ut si a mulieribus mundi essentpanes propositionis acciperent, quos omnino non acciperent, nisi prius mundos eos David a mulieribus fateretur.

          <p>them to abstain from women. And if so much cleanness A.D. 597.of body was there required, where God spoke to thepeople by the means of a subject creature, that those whowere to hear the words of God should not do so; howmuch more ought women, who receive the body ofAlmighty God, to preserve themselves in cleannessof ﬂesh, lest they be burdened with the very greatnessof that unutterable mystery? For this reason it wassaid to David, concerning his men, by the priest, that ifthey were clean in this particular, they should receivethe shewbread, which they would not have received atall, had not David ﬁrst declared them to be clean.Then the man, who, afterwards, has been washed withwater, is also capable of receiving the mystery of theholy communion, when it is lawful for him, according towhat has been before declared, to enter the church.Augustine’s N inth Question.——VVhether, after an illusion, such as happens in a dream, any man may receivethe body of our Lord, or if he be a priest, celebrate theDivine mysteries?Gregory answers.—The Testament of the Old Law, ashas been said already in the article above, calls such aman polluted, and allows him not to enter into the churchtill the evening after being washed with water. Which,nevertheless, spiritual people, taking in another sense,will understand in the same manner as above; becausehe is imposed upon as it were in a dream, who, beingtempted with ﬁlthiness, is deﬁled by real representationsin thought, and he is to be washed with water, that hemay cleanse away the sins of thought with tears; andunless the ﬁre of temptation depart before, may knowhimself to be guilty as it were until the evening. Butdiscretion is very necessary in that illusion, that one mayseriously consider what causes it to happen in the mindof the person sleeping; for sometimes it proceeds from excess of eating or drinking; sometimes from the superﬂuityor inﬁrmity of nature, and sometimes from the thoughts.</p>
          <p>Et quidem cum ex naturæ superﬂuitate vel infirmitateevenerit, omnimodo hæc illusio non est timenda; quiahanc animum nescientem pertulisse magis dolendum est,quam fecisse. Cum vero ultra. modum appetitus gulæ insumendis alimentis rapitur, atque idcirco humorum receptacula gravantur, habet exinde animus aliquem reatum,non tamen usque ad prohibitionem percipiendi sanctimysterii, vel missarum solennia celebrandi; cum fortasseaut festus dies exigit, a.ut exhiberi mysterium, (pro eoquod sacerdos alius in loco deest,) ipsa. necessitas compellit. Nam si adsunt alii, qui implere ministeriumvaleant, illusio per crapulam facta. a perceptione sacrimysterii prohibere non debet; sed ab immolatione sacrimysterii abstinere, ut arbitror, humiliter debet : si tamendormientis mentem turpi imaginatione non concusserit.Nam sunt quibus ita plerumque illusio nascitur, ut eorumanimus, etiam in somno corporis positus, turpibus imaginationibus non foedetur. Qua in re unum ibi ostendituripsa mens rea, non tamen vel suo judicio libera, cum se,etsi dormienti corpore, nihil meminit vidisse, tamen invigiliis corporis meminit in ingluviem cecidisse. Sin veroex turpi cogitatione vigilantis oritur illusio dormientis,patet animo reatus suus; videt enim a. qua. radice inquinatio illa processerit, quia, quod cogitavit sciens, hocprotulit nesciens.

          <p>And when it happens, either through superﬂuity or inﬁrmity A-D- 597of nature, such an illusion is not to be feared, becauseit is rather to be lamented, that the mind of the person,who knew nothing of it, suffers the same, than that heoccasioned it. But when the appetite of gluttony commits excess in food, and thereupon the receptacles of thehumours are oppressed, the mind from thence contractssome guilt; yet not so much as to obstruct the receivingof the holy mystery, or celebrating mass, when a holyday requires it, or necessity obliges the sacrament to beadministered, because there is no other priest in theplace; for if there be others who can perform the ministry, the illusion proceeding from over—eating is not toexclude a man from receiving the sacred mystery; but Iam of opinion he ought humbly to abstain from offeringthe sacriﬁce of the mystery; but not from receiving it,unless the mind of the person sleeping has been ﬁlledwith some foul imagination. For there are some, whofor the most part so suffer the illusion, that their mind,even during the sleep of the body, is not deﬁled withﬁlthy thoughts. In which case, one thing is evident,that the mind is guilty even in its own judgment; forthough it does not remember to have seen any thingwhilst the body was sleeping, yet it calls to mind thatwhen waking it fell into bodily gluttony. But if thesleeping illusion proceeds from evil thoughts when waking,then the guilt is manifest to the mind; for the man perceives from whence that ﬁlth sprung, because what hehad knowingly thought of, that he afterwards unwittinglyrevealed. But it is to be considered, whether thatthought was no more than a suggestion, or proceeded toenjoyment, or, Which is still more criminal, consented tosin. For all sin is fulﬁlled in three ways, viz. by suggestion, by delight, and by consent. Suggestion is occasioned by the Devil, delight is from the ﬂesh, and consent from the mind. For the serpent suggested theﬁrst offence, and Eve, as ﬂesh, was delighted with it, but.. 1</p>
          <p>vero, velut spiritus, consensit; et necessaria. est magnadiscretio, ut inter suggestionem atque delectationem,inter delectationem et consensum, judex sui animus præuideat. Cum enim malignus spiritus peccatum suggeritin mente, si nulla. peccati delectatio sequatur, peccatumomnimodo perpetratum non est; cum vero delectari carocoeperit, tunc peccatum incipit nasci; si autem ex deliberatione consentit, tunc peccatum cognoscitur perfici.In suggestione igitur peccati initium est, in delectationeﬁt nutrimentum, in consensu perfectio. Et sæpe contingit ut hoc, quod malignus spiritus seminat in cogita,tione, caro in delectationem trahat; nec tamen animaeidem delectationi consentiat. Et cum caro delectarisine animo nequeat, ipse tamen animus carnis voluptatibus reluctans in delectatione carnali aliquo modo ligaturinvitus, ut ei ex ratione contradicat, nec consentiat; ettamen delectatione ligatus sit, sed ligatum se vehementeringemiscat. Unde et ille cælestis exercitus præcipuusmiles gemebat.dicens, [Rom. vii. 23,] Video aliamlegem in membris meis repugnantem legi mentis meæ, «:captivum me ducentem in lege peccati, quæ est in membrismeis.

Epistolamvero, quam se Arelatensi episcopo fecisse commemorat,</p>
          <p>Adam Iconsented, as the spirit, or mind. And much A.D.597.discretion is requisite for the mind to sit as judge between suggestion and delight, and between delight andconsent. For if the evil spirit suggest a. sin to the mind,if there ensue no delight in the sin, the sin is in no waycommitted; but when the ﬂesh begins to be delighted,then sin begins to grow. But if it deliberately consents,then the sin is known to be perfected. The beginning,therefore, of sin is in the suggestion, the nourishing of itin delight, but in the consent is its perfection. And itoften happens that what the evil spirit sows in thethought, the ﬂesh draws to delight, and yet the soul doesnot consent to that delight. And whereas the ﬂeshcannot be delighted without the mind, yet the mindstruggling against the pleasures of the ﬂesh, is somewhatunwillingly tied down by the carnal delight, so thatthrough reason it contradicts, and does not consent, yetbeing inﬂuenced by delight, it grievously laments itsbeing so bound. Wherefore that principal soldier of ourLord’s host, sighing, said, “ I see another law in mymembers warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin, which is in mymembers.” Now if he was a captive, he did not ﬁght;but if he did ﬁght, why was he a captive? he thereforefought against the law of the mind, which the law thatis in the members opposed; if he fought so, he was nocaptive. Thus, then, man is, as I may say, a captiveand yet free. Free on account of justice, which he loves,a captive by the delight which he unwillingly bearswithin him.CHAP.

For if those temples are well built,it is requisite that they be converted from the worshipof devils to the service of the true God; that thenation, seeing that their temples are not destroyed,may remove error from their hearts, and knowing andadoring the true God, may the more familiarly resortto the places to which they have been accustomed.And because they have been used to slaughter manyoxen in the sacriﬁces to devils, some solemnity must beexchanged for them on this account, as that on the dayof the dedication, or the nativities of the holy martyrs,whose relics are there deposited, they may build themselves huts of the boughs of trees, about those churcheswhich have been turned to that use from temples, andcelebrate the solemnity with religious feasting, and nomore offer beasts to the Devil, but kill cattle to thepraise of God in their eating, and return thanks to theGiver of all things for their sustenance; to the endthat, whilst some gratiﬁcations are outwardly permittedthem, they may the more easily consent to the inwardeonsolations of the grace of God. For there is nodoubt that it is impossible to eﬁ‘ace every thing at oncefrom their obdurate minds; because he who endeavoursto ascend to the highest place, rises by degrees or steps,and not by leaps. Thus the Lord made himself knownto the people of Israel in Egypt; and yet he allowedthem the use of the sacriﬁces which they were wont tooffer to the Devil, in his own worship; so as to commandthem in his sacriﬁce to kill beasts, to the end that,changing their hearts, they might lay aside one part ofthe sacriﬁce, whilst they retained another; that whilstthey offered the same beasts which they were wont tooffer, they should offer them to God, and not to idols; and</p>

For we must call to mind,that when the disciples returned with joy after preaching,and said to their heavenly Master, ‘ Lord, in thy name,even the devils are subject to us;’ they were presentlytold, ‘ Do not rejoice on this account, but rather rejoicefor that your names are written in heaveu.’ For theyplaced their thoughts on private and temporal joys,when they rejoiced in miracles; but they are recalled from the private to the public, and from the temporal to</p>

This we know to "have been done in theEnglish nation, over whom your glory was thereforeplaced, that by means of the goods which are granted toyou, heavenly beneﬁts might also be conferred on thenation that is subject to you. Therefore, my illustriousson, do you carefully preserve the grace which you havereceived from the Divine goodness, and hasten to promote the Christian faith, which you have embraced,among the people under your subjection; multiply thezeal of your uprightness in their conversion; suppressthe worship of idols; overthrow the structures of thetemples; edify the manners of your subjects by muchcleanness of life, exhorting, terrifying, soothing, correcting, and giving examples of good works, that you mayﬁnd him your rewarder in heaven, whose name andknowledge you shall spread abroad upon earth: For healso Will render the fame of your honour more gloriousto posterity, whose honour you seek and maintain amongthe nations.For even so Constantine, our most pious emperor,recovering the Roman commonwealth from the perverseworship of idols, subjected the same with himself to ourAlmighty God and Lord J esus Christ, and was himself,with the people under his subjection, entirely converted tohim. VVhence it followed, that his praises transcendedthe fame of former princes; and he as much excelled hispredecessors in renown as he did in good works.

          <p>our most reverend brother, Bishop Augustine, who is A.D. 601.instructed in the monastical rule, full of the knowledgeof the holy Scripture, and, by the help of God, enduedwith good works; for if you give ear to him in what hespeaks for Almighty God, the same Almighty God willthe sooner hear him praying for you. But if (whichGod avert !) you slight his words, how shall AlmightyGod hear him in your behalf, when you neglect to hearhim for God? Unite yourself, therefore, to him withall your mind in the fervour of faith, and further his endeavours, through the assistance of that virtue which theDivinity affords you, that He may make you partaker ofhis kingdom, whose faith you cause to be received andmaintained in your own.“ Besides, we would have your glory know, we ﬁnd iiithe holy Scripture from the words of the Almighty Lord,that the end of this present world, and the kingdom ofthe saints, is about to come, which will never terminate.But as the same end of the world approaches, manythings are at hand which were not before, viz. changesof air, and terrors from heaven, and tempests out of theorder of the seasons, wars, famines, plagues, earthquakes in several places; which things will not, nevertheless, happen in our days, but will all follow after ourdays. If you, therefore, ﬁnd any of these things tohappen in your country, let not your mind he in any waydisturbed; for these signs of the end of the world aresent before, for this reason, that we may be solicitous forour souls, suspicious of the hour of death, and may befound prepared with good works to meet our J udge.Thus much, my illustrious son, I have said in few words,to the end that when the Christian faith shall increase inyour kingdom, our discourse to you may also be morecopious, and we may be pleased to say the more, in proportion as joy for the conversion of your nation is multiplied in our mind.“ I- have sent you some small presents, which will notK 2</p>

For beconquered more territories from the Britons, eithermaking them tributary, or driving the inhabitants cleanout, and planting English in their places, than any otherking or tribune. To him might justly be applied thesaying of the patriarch blessing his son in the person ofSaul, “ Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf ; in the morning heshall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide thespoil.” Hereupon, Aidan, king of the Scots that inhabitBritain, being concerned at his success, came againsthim With an immense and mighty army, but was beatenby an inferior force, and put to ﬂight; for almost all hisarmy was slain at a famous place, called Degsastan, thatis, Degsa—stone. In which battle also Theodbald, brotherto Ethelfrid, was killed, with almost all the forces hecommanded. This war Ethelfrid put an end to in theyear 603 after the incarnation of our Lord, the eleventhof his own reign, which lasted twenty-four years, and theﬁrst year of the reign of Phocas, who then governed theRoman empire.

          <p>ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORYOF THEENGLISH NATION.BOOK II.CHAP. I.—OF THE DEATH OF THE BLESSED POPE GREGORY.AT this time, that is, in the year of our Lord 605, Popes}:the blessed Pope Gregory, after having most gloriously Aa 605governed the Roman apostolic see thirteen years sixmonths and ten days, died, and was translated to theeternal see of the heavenly kingdom. Of whom, in regard that he by his zeal converted our nation, theEnglish, from the power of Satan to the faith of Christ,it behoves us to discourse more at large in our Ecclesi—astical History, for we may and ought rightly to call himour apostle; because, whereas he bore the pontiﬁcalpower over ' all the world, and was placed over thechurches already reduced to the faith of truth, he madeour nation, till then given up to idols, the church ofChrist, so that we may be allowed thus to attribute to. him the character of an apostle; for though he is notan apostle to others, yet he is so to us; for we are theseal of his apostleship in our Lord.He was by nation'a Roman, son of Gordian, deducinghis race from ancestors that were not only noble, butreligious. And Felix, once bishop of the‘same apostolical see, a man of great honour in Christ and his church,was his great-grandfather. Nor did he exercise the nobility of religion with less virtue of devotion than his</p>
          <p>Nobilitatem vero illam, quam ad seculum videbatur habere, totam ad nanciscendam supernæ gloriam dignitatis,divina gratia largiente, convertit. Nam mutato repentehabitu seculari, monasterium petiit, in quo tanta perfectionis gratia coepit conversari ut, sicut ipse postea fiendeattestari solebat animo illius labentia cuncta subtemesent, ut rebus omnibus quæ volvuntur emineret, ut nulla.nisi cælestia cogitare soleret, ut etiam retentus corporeipsa. jam carnis claustra contemplatione transiret, utmortem quoque, quæ pene cunctis poena est, videlicet, utingressum vitæ et laboris sui præmium, amaret. Hocautem ipse de se, non profectum jactando virtutum, seddeﬂendo potius defectum, quem, (ut referre consueverat,)sibi per curam pastoralem incurrisse videbatur. Denique,tempore quodam secreto, cum diacono suo Petro colloquens, enumeratis animi sui virtutibus priscis, mox dolendo subjunxit ; “ At nunc ex occasione curæ pastoralissecularium hominum negotia patitur, et post tam pulcram quietis suæ speciem terreni actus pulvere fædatur.Cnmque se pro condescensione multorum ad exteriorasparserit, etiam cum interiora appetit, ad hæc proculdubio minor redit.

          <p>parents and kindred. But that worldly nobility which Life of Popehe seemed to have, by the help of the Divine Grace, he 239%.entirely used to gain the honour of eternal dignity; forsoon quitting his secular habit, he repaired to a monastery, wherein he began to behave himself with so muchgrace of perfection, that (as he was afterwards wont withtears to testify) his mind was above all transitory things;that he despised all that is subject to change; that heused to think of nothing but what was heavenly; thatwhilst detained by the body, he by contemplation brokethrough the bonds of the ﬂesh; and that he loved death,which is a terror to almost all men, as the entrance intolife, and the reward of his labours. This he said ofhimself, not to boast of his progress in virtue, but ratherto bewail the decay, which, as he was wont to declare, beimagined he sustained through the pastoral care. Inshort, when he was, one day, in private, discoursing withPeter, his deacon, after having enumerated the formervirtues of his mind, he with grief added, “ But now, onaccount of the pastoral care, it is entangled with theaffairs of laymen, and after so beautiful an appearance ofrepose, is deﬁled with the dust of earthly action. Andafter having wasted itself by condescending to manythings that are without, when it desires the inwardthings, it returns to them less qualiﬁed to enjoy them.Itherefore consider what I endure, I consider what Ihave lost, and when I behold that loss, what I bear appears the more grievous.”This the holy man said out of the excess of his humility. But it becomes us to believe that he lost nothingof his monastic perfection by his pastoral care, but ratherthat he improved the more through the labour of theconversion of many, than by the former repose of hisconversation; and chieﬂy because, whilst exercising thepontiﬁcal function, he provided to have his house madea monastery. And when ﬁrst drawn from the monastery, ordained to the ministry of the altar, and sent as</p>

By their company he was not onlyguarded against earthly assaults, but more and more inﬂamed in the exercises of a heavenly life.For they persuaded him to give a mystical expositionof the book of holy Job, which is involved in great obscurity; nor could he refuse to undertake that work,which brotherly affection imposed on him for the futurebeneﬁt of many; but in a wonderful manner, in ﬁve andthirty books of exposition, taught how that same bookis to be understood literally; how to be referred to themysteries of Christ and the church; and in what senseit is to be adapted to every one of the faithful. Thiswork he began when legate in the royal city, but ﬁnishedit at Rome after being made pope. Whilst he was stillin the royal city, he, by the assistance of the Divinegrace of Catholic truth, crushed in its ﬁrst rise a heresynewly started, concerning the state of our resurrection.For Eutychius, bishop of that city, taught, that ourbody, in that glory of resurrection, would be impalpable,and more subtile than the wind and air; which he hearing, proved by force of truth, and by the instance of theresurrection of our Lord, that this doctrine was everyway opposite to the Christian faith. For the Catholiefaith is that our body, sublimed by the glory of immortality, is rendered subtile by the effect of the spiritual</p>

"8°35.from the dead, he himself says to his disciples, “ Touchme and see, for a spirit hath not ﬂesh and bones, as yesee me have.” In asserting which faith, the venerableFather Gregory so earnestly laboured against the risingheresy, and by the assistance of the most pious emperor,Tiberius Constantine, so fully suppressed it, that nonehas been since found to revive it.He likewise composed another notable book, called“ Liber Pastoralis,” wherein he manifestly showed whatsort of persons ought to be preferred to govern thechurch ; how such rulers ought to live ; with how muchdiscretion to instruct every one of their hearers, andhow seriously to reﬂect every day on their own frailty.He also wrote forty homilies on the Gospel, which beequally divided into two volumes; and composed fourbooks of dialogues, into which, at the request of Peter,his deacon, he collected the miracles of the saints whomhe either knew, or had heard to be most renowned inItaly, for an example to posterity to lead their lives ; tothe end that, as in his books of Expositions, what virtuesought to be laboured for, so by describing the miraclesof saints, he might make known the glory of those virtues.He further, in twenty-two homilies, discovered howmuch light there is concealed in the ﬁrst and last partsof the prophet Ezekiel, which seemed the most obscure.Besides which, he wrote the “ Book of Answers," to thequestions of Augustine, the ﬁrst bishop of the Englishnation, as we have shown above, inserting the samebook entire in this history; besides the useful little“Synodical Book,” which he composed with the bishopsof Italy on the necessary affairs of the church; and alsofamiliar letters to certain persons. And it is the morewonderful that he could write so many and such largevolumes, in regard that almost all the time of his youth,</p>

          <p>to use his own words, he was often tormented with pains Iétfe ofPopein his bowels, and a weakness of his stomach, whilst he Argaiwas continually suﬁ'ering from slow fever. But whereasat the same time he carefully reﬂected that, as theScripture testiﬁes, “ Every son that is received isscourged,” the more he laboured and was depressedunder those present evils, the more he assured himselfof his eternal salvation.Thus much may be said of his immortal genius, whichcould not be restrained by such severe bodily pains; forother popes applied themselves to building, or adorningof churches with gold and silver, but Gregory wasentirely intent upon gaining souls. Whatsoever moneyhe had, he diligently took care to distribute and give tothe poor, that his righteousness might endure for ever,and his horn be exalted with honour; so that whatblessed J ob said might be truly said of him, “ When theear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye sawme, it gave witness to me: because I delivered the poorthat cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none tohelp him. The blessing of him that was ready to perishcame upon me, and I caused the widow’s heart to singfor joy. I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; myjudgment was as a robe and a diadem. I was the eye tothe blind, and feet was I to the lame. I was father tothe poor; and the cause which I knew not, I searchedout. And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and pluckedthe spoil out of his teeth.” And a little after: “If Ihave withheld,” says he, “ the poor from their desire;or have caused the eye of the widow to fail; or haveeaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hathnot eaten thereof. For of my youth compassion grewup with me, and from my mother’s womb it came forthwith me.” _To these works of piety and righteousness this alsomay be added, that he saved our nation, by the preachershe sent hither, from the teeth of the old enemy, andL</p>

Quia enim, perceptis coelestibus verbis, clarescentibus quoque miraculis,virtus ei divinæ cognitionis infunditur, ejusdem divinitatis terrore refrænatur, ut prave agere metuat, ac totisdesideriis ad æternitatis gratiam venire concupiscat.”Quibus verbis beatus Gregorius hoc quoque declarat,quia Sanctus Augustinus et socii ejus non sola prædicatione verborum, sed etiam coelestium ostensione signorum, gentem Anglorum ad agnitionem veritatis perducebant. Fecit inter alia beatus Papa. Gregorius, utin ecclesiis sanctorum apostolorum Petri et Pauli, supercorpora eorum missæ celebrarentur. Sed et in ipamissarum celebratione tria verba maximæ perfectionisplena superadjecit, “ Diesque nostros in tua pace disponas, atque ab æterna damnatione nos eripi, et in electorum tuorum jubeas grege numerari."Rexit autem ecclesiam temporibus imperatorum Mauricii et Phocatis; secundo autem ejusdem Phocatis annotransiens ex hac vita. migravit ad veram, quæ in cælisest, vitam.

          <p>made it partaker of eternal liberty; in whose faith and Life of Popesalvation rejoicing, and worthily commending the same, Agam.he 1n his exposition on holy J ob says, “Behold, a. tongueof Britain, which only knew how to utter barbarouslanguage, has long since begun to resound the HebrewHallelujah ! Behold, the once swelling ocean now servesprostrate at the feet of the saints; and its barbarousmotions, which earthly princes could not subdue with thesword, are now, through the fear of God, bound by themouths of priests with words only; and he that whenan inﬁdel stood not in awe of ﬁghting troops, now abeliever, fears the tongues of the humble ! For by rea.son that the virtue of the Divine knowledge is infusedinto it by precepts, heavenly words, and conspicuousmiracles, it is curbed by the dread of the same Divinity,so as to fear to act wickedly, and bends all its desires toarrive at eternal glory.” In which words holy Gregorydeclares this also, that St. Augustine and his companionsbrought the English to receive the truth, not only bythe preaching of words, but also by showing of heavenlysigns. The holy Pope Gregory, among other things,caused masses to be celebrated in the churches of theapostles, Peter and Paul, over their bodies. And in thecelebration of masses, he added three words full of greatgoodness and perfection: “And dispose our days in thypeace, and preserve us from eternal damnation, and rankus in the number of thy elect, through Christ our Lord.”He governed the church in the days of the EmperorsMauritius and Phocas, but passing out of this life in thesecond year of the same Phocas, he departed to the truelife which is' in heaven. His body was buried in thechurch of St. Peter the Apostle, before the sacristy, onthe 4th day of March, to rise one day in the same bodyin glory with the rest of the holy pastors of the church.On his tomb was written this epitaph :—Earth! take that body which at ﬁrst you gave,Till God again shall raise it from the grave.L 2</p>

Itis reported, that some merchants, having just arrivedat Rome on a certain day, exposed many things for salein the market—place, and abundance of people resortedthither to buy: Gregory himself went with the rest,and, 'among other things, some boys were set to sale,their bodies white, their countenances beautiful, andtheir hair very ﬁne. Having viewed them, he asked,as is said, from what country or nation they werebrought? and was told, from the island of Britain,whose inhabitants were of such personal appearance. He again inquired whether those islanders wereChristians, or still involved in the errors of paganism?and was informed that they were pagans.

For they did notkeep Easter Sunday at the proper time, but from thefourteenth to the twentieth moon; which computationis contained in a revolution of eighty-four years. Besides, they did several other things which were againstthe unity of the church. When, after a long disputation,they did not comply with the entreaties, exhortations,or rebukes of Augustine and his companions, but preferred their own traditions before all the churches inthe world, which in Christ agree among themselves, theholy father, Augustine, put an end to this troublesomeand tedious contention, saying, “ Let us beg of God,who causes those who are of one mind to live in hisFather’s house, that he will vouchsafe, by his heavenlytokens, to declare to us, which tradition is to be followed; and by what meahs we are to ﬁnd our way tohis heavenly kingdom. Let some inﬁrm person bebrought, and let the faith and practice of those, bywhose prayers he shall be healed, be looked upon as. acceptable to God, and be adopted by all." The adverseparty unwillingly consenting, a blind man of the Englishrace was brought, who having been presented to the</p>

Nec mora,, illuminatur cæcus, ac verus summæ lucis præco ab omnibusprædicatur Augustinus. Tum Britones conﬁtentur quidem intellexisse se veram esse viam justitiæ, quam prædicaret Augustinus; sed non se posse absque suorumconsensu ac licentia priscis abdicare moribus. Undepostulabant ut secundo synodus pluribus advenientibusﬁeret.Quod cum esset statutum, venerunt, ut perhibent, septem Britonum episcopi et plures viri doctissimi, maximede nobilissimo eorum monasterio, quod vocatur lingua.Anglorum Bancomaburg, cui tempore illo Dinooth abbaspræfuisse narratur, qui ad præfatum ituri concilium venerunt primo ad quendam virum sanctum ac prudentem,qui apud eos anachoreticam ducere vitam solebat, consulentes an ad predicationem Augustini suas 'dæereretraditiones deberent. Qui respondebat, “ Si homo Deiest, sequimini illum.” Dixerunt, “ Et unde hoc possumus probare?" At ille, “ Dominus," inquit, “ ait,[Matt. xi. 29,] Tollite jugum meum super 'vos, et discitea me, quia mitis sum et humilis corde. Si ergo Augustinus ille mitis est et humilis corde, credibile est quiajugum Christi et ipse portet et vobis portandum oﬂ'erat;sin autem immitis ac superbus est, constat quia non est.de Deo, neque nobis ejus sermo curandus.” Qui rursusaiebant, “ Et unde vel hoc dignoscere valemus ?”—“Procurate,” inquit, “ ut ipse prior cum suis ad locum synodi</p>
          <p>priests of the Britons, found no beneﬁt or cure from änætäütheir ministry; at length, Augustine, compelled by gaf? mreal necessity, bowed his knees to the Father of our ' ' 'Lord J esus Christ, praying that the lost sight might berestored to the blind man, and by the corporeal enlightening of one man, the light of spiritual grace mightbe kindled in the hearts of many of the faithful. Immediately the blind man received sight, and Augustine wasby all declared the preacher of the Divine truth. TheBritons then confessed, that it was the true way ofrighteousness which Augustine taught; but that theycould not depart from their ancient customs without theconsent and leave of their people. They thereforedesired that a second synod might be appointed, atwhich more of their number would be present.This being decreed, there came (as is asserted) sevenbishops of the Britons, and many most learned men, particularly from their most noble monastery, which, in theEnglish tongue, is called Bancornaburg, over which theAbbot Dinooth is said to have presided at that time.They that were to go to the aforesaid council, repairedﬁrst to a certain holy and discreet man, who was wontto lead an eremitical life among them, advising with him,whether they ought, at the preaching of Augustine, toforsake their traditions. He answered, “ If he is a. manof God, follow him."—“ How shall we know that ?" saidthey. He replied, “Our Lord saith, Take my yokeupon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly inheart; if, therefore, Augustine is meek and lowly ofheart, it is to be believed that he has taken upon himthe yoke of Christ, and offers the same to you to takeupon you. But, if he is stern and haughty, it appearsthat he is not of God, nor are we to regard his words.”They insisted again, “ And how shall we discern eventhis?”—“Do you contrive,” said the anchorite, “ thathe may ﬁrst arrive with his company at the place where</p>

Dicebatautem eis, “ Quia in multis quidem nostræ consuetudini,imo universalis ecclesiæ, contraria. geritis; et tamen siin tribus his mihi obtemperare vultis, ut Pascha suotempore celebretis ; ut ministerium baptizandi, quo Deorenascimur, juxta morem sanctæ Romanæ et apostolicæecclesiæ compleatis; ut genti Anglorum una. nobiscumverbum Domini prædicatis; cetera quæ agitis, quamvismoribus nostris contraria, æquanimiter cuncta. tolerabimus." At illi nil horum se facturos, neque illum proarchiepiscopo habituros esse respondebant; conferentesad invicem, “ Quia si modo nobis assurgere noluit, quantomagis, si ei subdi cæperimus, jam nos pro nihilo comtemnet!” Quibus vir Domini Augustinus fertur minitans praedixisse, quia si pacem cum fratribus acciperenollent, bellum ab hostibus forent accepturi ; et sinationi Anglorum noluissent viam vitæ prædicare, perhorum manus ultionem essent mortis passuri. Quod itaper omnia, ut praedixerat, divino agente judicio, patratum est. 'Siquidem post hæc ipse, de quo diximus, rex Anglorum fortissimus Ethelfridus, collecto grandi exercitu, adCivitatem Legionum, quæ a gente Anglorum Legacestir,a Britonibus autem rectius Carlegion appellatur, maximam gentis perﬁdae stragem dedit.

He saidto them, “ You act in many particulars contrary to ourcustom, or rather the custom of the universal church,and yet, if you will comply with me in these three points,viz. to keep Easter at the due time; to administer baptism, by which we are again born to God, according tothe custom of the holy Roman Apostolic Church; andjointly with us to preach the word of God to the Englishnation, we will readily tolerate all the other things youdo, though contrary to our customs." They answeredthey would do none of those things, nor receive him astheir archbishop; for they alleged among themselves,that “ if he would not now rise up to us, how much morewill he contemn us, as of no worth, if we shall begin tobe under his subjection?” To whom the man of God,Augustine, is said, in a threatening manner, to haveforetold, that in case they would not join in unity withtheir brethren, they should be warred upon by theirenemies; and, if they would not preach the way of lifeto the English nation, they should at their hands undergo the vengeance of death. All which, through thedispensation of the Divine judgment, fell out exactly ashe had predicted.For the warlike king of the English, Ethelfrid, having Slaughter ofraised a mighty army, made a very great slaughter of &amp;???"that perﬁdious nation, at the City of Legions, which bythe English is called Legacestir, but by the 'Britonsmore rightly Carlegion.

Mostof them were of the monastery of Bangor, in which, it isreported, there was so greata number of monks, that themonastery being divided into seven parts, with a rulerover each, none of those parts contained less than threehundred men, who all lived by the labour of their hands.Many of these, having observed a fast of three days,resorted among others to pray at the aforesaid battle,having one Brocmail appointed for their protector, todefend them whilst they were intent upon their prayers,against the swords of the barbarians. King Ethelfridbeing informed of the occasion of their coming, said,“ If then they cry to their god against us, in truth,though they do not bear arms, yet they ﬁght against us,because they oppose us by their prayers.” He, therefore, commanded them to be attacked ﬁrst, 'and thendestroyed the rest of the impious army, not withoutconsiderable loss of his own forces. About twelve hundred of those that came to pray are said to have beenkilled, and only ﬁfty to have escaped by ﬂight. Brocmail turning his back with his men, at the ﬁrst approachof the enemy, left those whom he ought to have defended, unarmed and exposed to the swords of the enemies. Thus was fulﬁlled the prediction of the holy BishopAugustine, though he himself had been long before takenup into the heavenly kingdom; that those perﬁdions menshould feel the vengeance of temporal death also, becausethey had despised the offer of eternal salvation.CHAP. III.—HOW ST. AUGUSTINE MADE MELLITUS ANDws'ws BISHOPS; AND on 1113 DEATH.IN the year of our Lord 604, Augustine, archbishop Melmus andJustin conseof Britain, ordained two bishops, viz.

Their metropolis is thecity of London, which is situated on the bank of theaforesaid river, and is the mart of many nations resorting to it by sea and land. At that time, Sabert,nephew to Ethelbert by his sister Ricula, reigned overthe nation, though he was under subjection to Ethelbert,who, as has been said above, had command over allthe nations of the English as far as the river Humber.But when this province also received the word of truth,by the preaching of Mellitus, King Ethelbert built thechurch of St. Paul, in the city of London, where heand his successors should have their episcopal see. Asfor J ustus, Augustine ordained him bishop in Kent,at the city which the English nation named Rhofescestir, from one that was formerly the chief man of it,called Rhof. It is almost twenty-four miles distantfrom the city of Canterbury to the westward, and contains a church dedicated to St. Andrew, the apostle.King Ethelbert, who built it, bestowed many gifts onthe bishops of both those churches, as well as on thatof Canterbury, adding lands and possessions for theuse of those who were with the bishops.After this, the beloved of God, Father Augustine, Augustine’sdied, and his body was deposited without, close by the 173.1305.church of the apostles, Peter and Paul, above spokenof, by reason that the same was not yet ﬁnished, norconsecrated, but as soon as it was dedicated, the bodywas brought in, and decently buried in the north porchthereof; wherein also were interred the bodies of allthe succeeding archbishops, except two only, Theodorusangl Berthwald, whose bodies are within that church,because the aforesaid porch could contain no more.Almost in the midst of this church is an altar dedicatedin honour of the blessed Pope Gregory, at which everySaturday their service is solemnly performed by theM</p>

IV.—-LAURENTIUS AND ms BISHOPS ADMONISH THESCOTS TO OBSERVE THE UNITY OF THE HOLY CHURCH,PARTICULARLY IN KEEPING OF EASTER; MELLITUS GOESTO ROME.LAURENTIUS succeeded Augustine in the bishopric, Laurentiushaving been ordained thereto by the latter, in his ïfïïeägäïlifetime, lest, upon his death, the state of the church,as yet unsettled, might begin to falter, if it should bedestitute of a pastor, though but for one hour. Whereinhe also followed the example of the ﬁrst pastor of thechurch, that is, of the most blessed prince of theapostles, Peter, who, having founded the church ofChrist at Rome, is said to have consecrated Clementhis assistant in preaching the Gospel, and at the sametime his successor. Laurentius, being advanced to thedegree of an archbishop, laboured indefatigably, bothby frequent exhortations and examples of piety, to raiseto perfection the foundations of the church, which hadbeen so nobly laid. In short, he not only took care ofthe new church formed among the English, but endeavoured also to employ his pastoral solicitude among theancient inhabitants of Britain, as also the Scots, whoinhabit the island of Ireland, which is next to Britain.For when he understood that the course of life andprofession of the Scots in their aforesaid country, asM 2</p>

Thebeginning of which epistle is as follows :—“ To our most dear brothers, the lords bishops and msiemnoabbots throughout all Scotland, Laurentius, Mellitus, :‘ieeiffe‘iiumand Justus, servants of the servants of God. When 'the apostolic see, according to the universal customwhich it has followed elsewhere, sent us to these westernparts to preach to pagan nations, we came into thisisland, which is called Britain, without possessing anyprevious knowledge of its inhabitants. We held boththe Britons and Scots in great esteem for sanctity,believing that they had proceeded according to thecustom of the universal church; but coming acquaintedwith the errors of the Britons, we thought the Scotshad been better; but we have been informed by BishopDagan, coming into this aforesaid island, and the AbbotColumbanus in France, that the Scots in no way differfrom the Britons in their behaviour ; for Bishop Dagancoming to us, not only refused to eat with us, but evento take his repast in the same house where we wereentertained.”The same Laurentius and his fellow-bishops wrote aletter to the priests of the Britons, suitable to his rank,by which he endeavoured to conﬁrm them in Catholicunity; but what he gained by so doing the presenttimes still declare.About this time, Mellitus, bishop of London, went to gegan- goeRome, to confer with Pope Boniface about the neces- A.D. 610.sary affairs of the English church.

The ﬁfth wasEdwin, king of the nation of the Northumbrians, thatis, of those who‘live on the north side of the river Humber, who, with great power, commanded all the nations,as well of the English as of the Britons who inhabitBritain, except only the people of Kent, and he reducedalso under the dominion of the English the Mevanianislands of the Britons, lying between Ireland and Britain; the sixth was Oswald, the most Christian king ofthe N orthumbrians, who also had the same extent underhis command; the seventh, Oswy, brother to the former,held the same dominions for some time, and for the mostpart subdued and made tributary the nations of thePicts and Scots, which possess the northern parts ofBritain: but of these hereafter.King Ethelbert died on the 24th day of the month ofFebruary, twenty-one years after he had received thefaith, and was buried in St. Martin’s porch Within thechurch of the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, wherealso lies his queen, Bertha. Among other beneﬁtswhich he conferred upon the nation, he also, by theadvice of wise persons, introduced judicial decrees, afterthe Roman model; which, being written in English,are still kept and observed by them. Among which, hein the ﬁrst place set down what satisfaction should begiven by those who should steal any thing belonging tothe church, the bishop, or the other clergy, resolving togive protection to those whose doctrine he had embraced.This Ethelbert was the son of Irminric, whose fatherwas Octa, whose father was Orric, surnamed Oisc, from</p>

A.D. 616.His father was Hengist, who, being invited by Vortigem, ﬁrst came into Britain, with his son Oisc, as hasbeen said above.But after the death of Ethelbert, his son Eadbald ascending the throne, proved very prejudicial to the newchurch; for he not only refused to embrace the faith ofChrist, but was also deﬁled with such a sort of fornication, as the apostle testiﬁes, was not heard of, evenamong the Gentiles; for he kept his father’s wife. Byboth which crimes he gave occasion to those to return totheir former uncleanness, who, under his father, had,either for favour, or through fear of the king, submittedto the laws of faith and chastity. Nor did the perﬁdiousking escape without Divine punishment and correction;for he was troubled with frequent ﬁts of madness, andpoæessed by an evil spirit. This confusion was increasedby the death of Sabert, king of the East Saxons, who,departing to the heavenly kingdom, left three sons, stillpagans, to inherit his temporal crown. They immediately began to profess idolatry, which, during theirfather’s reign, they had seemed a little to abandon, andthey granted free liberty to the people under theirgovernment to serve idols. And when they saw thebishop, whilst celebrating mass in the church, give theeucharist to the people, they, puﬁ'ed up with barbarousfolly, were wont, as it is reported, to say to him, “ Whydo you not give us also that white bread, which youused to give to our father Saba, (for so they used to callhim,) and which you still continue to give to the peoplein the church 3” To whom he answered, “ If you will bewashed in that laver of salvation, in which your fatherwas washed, you may also partake of the holy bread ofwhich he partook; but if you despise the laver of life,you may not receive the bread of life.” They replied,“ We will not enter into that laver, because we do notknow that we stand in need of it, and yet we will eat of</p>

Being forced from thence, he came into Kent,to advise with his fellow—bishops, Laurentius and J ustus,what was to be done in that case; and it was unanimouslyagreed, that it was better for them all to return to theirown country, where they might serve God in freedom,than to continue without any advantage among those barbarians, who had revolted from the faith. Mellitus and E31323:Justus accordingly went away ﬁrst, and withdrew into Britain.France, designing there to await the event of things. Butthe kings, who had driven from them the preacher ofthe truth, did not continue long unpunished in theirheathenish worship. For marching out to battle againstthe nation of the Gewissae, they were all slain with theirarmy. However, the people, having been once turnedto wickedness, though the authors of it were destroyed,would not be corrected, nor return to the unity of faithand charity which is in Christ.CHAP.

The king, astonished, asked,“ Who had presumed to give such stripes to so great aman ?" And was much frightened when he heard thatthe bishop had suffered so much at the hands of theapostle of Christ for his salvation. Then abjuring theworship of idols, and renouncing his unlawful marriage,he embraced the faith of Christ, and being baptized,promoted the aﬂ'airs of the church to the utmost of hispower. .He also sent over into France, and recalled Mellitus Mellltus andand J ustus, and commanded them freely to return tommgovern their churches, which they accordingly did, oneyear after their departure. J ustus, indeed, returned tothe city of Rochester, where he had before presided;but the Londoners would not receive Bishop Mellltus,choosing rather to be under their idolatrous high priests ;for King Eadbald had not so much authority in thekingdom as his father, nor was he able to restore thebishop to his church against the will and consent of the.pagans. But he and his nation, after his conversion toour Lord, diligently followed the Divine precepts. Lastly,he built the church of the holy Mother of God, in themonastery of the most blessed prince of the apostles,which was afterwards consecrated by Archbishop Mellitus.</p>

Mellitus, who was bishop ofLondon, was the third archbishop of Canterbury fromAugustine; Justus, who was still living, governed thechurch of Rochester. These ruled the church of theEnglish with much industry and labour, and receivedletters of exhortation from Boniface, bishop of theRoman apostolic see, who presided over the church afterDeusdedit, in the year of our Lord 619. Mellitus la.boured under an inﬁrmity of body, that is, the gout ; buthis mind was sound, cheerfully passing over all earthlythings, and always aspiring to love, seek, and attain tothose which are celestial. He was noble by birth, butmuch nobler in mind.In short, that I may give one testimony of his virtue,by which the rest may be guessed at, it happened oncethat the city of Canterbury, being by carelessness set onﬁre; was in danger of being consumed by the spreadingconﬂagratiou; water was thrown over the ﬁre in vain;a considerable part of the city was already destroyed,and the ﬁerce ﬂame advancing towards the bishop, whenhe, conﬁding in the Divine assistance, where humanfailed, ordered himself to be carried towards the ragingﬁre, that was spreading on every side.

Nordid he deny, but that he would embrace the same religion, if, being examined by wise persons, it should befound more holy and more worthy of God.Hereupon the virgin was promised, and sent to Edwin,and pursuant to what had been agreed on, Panlinus, aman beloved of God, was ordained bishop, to go with her,and by daily exhortations, and celebrating the heavenlymysteries, to conﬁrm her, and her company, lest theyshould be corrupted by the company of the pagans.Paulinus was ordained bishop by the ArchbishopJustus, on the 2151; day of J uly, in the year of ourLord 625, and so he came to King Edwin with theaforesaid virgin, as a companion of their union in theﬂesh. But his mind was wholly bent upon reducing thenation to which he was sent to the knowledge of truth;according to the words of the apostle, “ To espouse herto one husband, that he might present her as a chastevirgin to Christ.” Being come into that province, helaboured much, not only to retain those that went withhim, by the help of God, that they should not revolt fromthe faith, but, if he could, to convert some of the pagansto a state of grace by his preaching. But, as the apostle says, though he laboured long in the word, “ Thegod of this world blinded the minds of them that believed not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christshould shine unto them.”</p>

He hada two-edged dagger, dipped in poison, to the end, that ifthe wound were not sufﬁcient to kill the king, it mightbe performed by the venom. He came to the king onthe ﬁrst day of Easter, at the river Derwent, where thenstood the regal city, and being admitted as if to delivera message from his master, whilst he was in an artfulmanner delivering his pretended embassy, he started ona sudden, and drawing the dagger under his garment,assaulted the king; which Lilla, the king’s most belovedminister, observing, having no buckler at hand to securethe king from death, he interposed his own body toreceive the stroke; but the wretch struck so home, thathe wounded the king through the knight’s body. Beingthen attacked on all sides with swords, he in that confu— 'sion also slew another soldier, whose name was Forthhere.On that same holy night of Easter Sunday, the queenhad brought forth to the king a daughter, called Eanﬂed.The king, in the presence of Bishop Paulinus, gavethanks to his gods for the birth of his daughter; andthe bishop, on the other hand, returned thanks to Christ,and endeavoured to persuade the king, that by his prayersto him he had obtained, that the queen should bringforth the child in safety, and without much pain. Theking, delighted with his words, promised, that in caseGod would grant him life and victory over the king bywhom the assassin had been sent, he would cast off hisidols, and serve Christ; and in earnest that he wouldperform his promise, he delivered up that same daughterto Paulinus, to be consecrated to Christ. She was theﬁrst baptized of the nation of the Northumbrians, onWhitsunday, with twelve others of her family.

When Ethelfrid, his predecessor,was persecuting him, he for many years wandered in &amp;private manner through several places and kingdoms,and at last came to Redwald, beseeching him to give himprotection against the snares of his powerful persecutor.Redwald willingly admitted him, and promised to perform what he requested. But when Ethelfrid understood that he had appeared in that province, and thathe and his companions were hospitably entertained byRedwald, he sent messengers to oﬁ'er that king a greatsum of money to murder him, but without effect. Hesent a second and a third time, bidding more and moreeach time, and threatening to make war on him if herefused. Redwald, either terriﬁed by his threats, orgained by his gifts, complied with his request, and promised either to kill Edwin, or to deliver him up to theambassadors. This being observed by a trusty friendof his, he went into his chamber, where he was goingto bed, for it was the ﬁrst hour of the night; and callinghim out, discovered what the king had promised to dowith him, adding, “ If, therefore, you think ﬁt, I willthis very hour conduct you out of this province, andlead you to a. place where neither Redwald nor Ethelfridshall ever ﬁnd you.” He answered, “ I thank you foryour good will, yet I cannot do what you propose, or beguilty of breaking the compact I have made with sogreat a king, when he has done me no harm, nor offeredme any injury; but, on the contrary, if I must die, let</p>

For whither shall I now ﬂy, when I have forso many years been a vagabond through all the provincesof Britain, to escape the hands of my enemies?” Hisfriend being gone, Edwin remained alone without, andsitting with a heavy heart before the palace, began tobe overwhelmed with many thoughts, not knowing whatto do, or which way to turn himself.When he had remained a long time in silence,brooding over his misfortunes in anguish of mind, he,on a. sudden, in the dead of night, saw approaching aperson, whose face and habit were equally strange, atwhich unexpected sight he was not a little frightened.The stranger coming close up, saluted him, and askedhim, “Why he sat there alone and melancholy on astone at that time, when all others were taking theirrest, and were fast asleep?” Edwin, in his turn, asked,“ What it was to him, whether he spent the night withindoors or abroad?" The stranger, in reply, said, “ Donot think that I am ignorant of the cause of your grief,your watching, and sitting alone without. For I knowWho you are, and why you grieve, and the evils whichyou fear will fall upon you. But tell me, what rewardyou will give the man that shall deliver you out of thisanguish, and persuade Redwald neither to do you anyharm himself, nor to deliver you up to be murdered byyour enemies.” Edwin replied, “That he would givethat person all that he was able for so singular a favour.”The other further added, “ What if I also assure you,that you shall overcome your enemies, and surpass inpower, not only all your own progenitors, but even allthat have reigned before you over the English nation ?"Edwin, encouraged by these questions, did not hesitateto promise that he would make a suitable return to himwho should so highly oblige him. Then said the other,“But if he who foretells so much good as is to befallyou, can also give you better advice for your life and</p>

For as soon as the ambassadors were returned home, he raised a mighty army to make war onEthelfrid; who, meeting him with much inferior forces,(for Redwald had not given him time to gather all hispower,) was slain on the borders of the kingdom ofMercia, on the east side of the river that is called Idle.</p>

Behold youhave of his gift obtained the kingdom which you desired.

To which the chief ofhis own priests, Coiﬁ, immediately answered, “ 0 king,consider what this is which is now preached to us; for Iverily declare to you, that the religion which we havehitherto professed has, as far as I can learn, no virtue init. For none of your people has applied himself morediligently to the worship of our gods than I; and yetthere are many who receive greater favours from you,and are more preferred than I, and are more prosperousin all their undertakings. Now if the gods were goodfor any thing, they would rather forward me, who hayebeen more careful to serve them. It remains, therefore,that if upon examination you ﬁnd those new doctrines,which are now preached to us, better and more efﬁcacious, we immediately receive them without any delay.”Another of the king’s chief men, approving of hiswords and exhortations, presently added : “ The presentlife of man, O king, seems to me, in comparison of thattime which is unknown to us, like to the swift ﬂight of asparrow through the room wherein you sit at supper inwinter, with your commanders and ministers, and a goodﬁre in the midst, whilst the storms of rain and snowprevail abroad; the sparrow, I say, ﬂying in at onedoor, and immediately out at another, whilst he iswithin, is safe from the wintry storm ; but after a. shortspace of fair weather, he immediately vanishes out ofyour sight, into the dark winter from which he hademerged. So this life of man appears for a short space,but of what went before, or what is to follow, we areutterly ignorant. If, therefore, this new doctrine contains something more certain, it seems justly to deserveto be followed." The other elders and king’s counsellors,by Divine inspiration, spoke to the same effect.But Coiﬁ added, that he wished more attentively tohear Paulinus discourse concerning the God whom heP 2</p>

For whichreason I advise, 0 king, that we instantly abjure and setﬁre to those temples and altars which we have consecrated without reaping any beneﬁt from them.” Inshort, the king publicly gave his license to Paulinus topreach the Gospel, and renouncing idolatry, declaredthat he received the faith of Christ: and when he inquired of the high priest who should ﬁrst profane thealtars and temples of their idols, with the enclosuresthat were about them, he answered, “ I; for who canmore properly than myself destroy those things which Iworshipped through ignorance, for an example to allothers, through the wisdom which has been given meby the true God?" Then immediately, in contempt ofhis former superstitions, he desired the king to furnishhim with arms and a. stallion; and mounting the same,he set out to destroy the idols; for it was not lawfulbefore for the high priest either to carry arms, or toride on any but a. mare. Having, therefore, girt a. swordabout him, with a. spear in his hand, he mounted theking’s stallion and proceeded to the idols. The multitude beholding it, concluded he was distracted; but helost no time, for as soon as he drew near the temple heprofaned the same, casting into it the spear which heheld; and rejoicing in the knowledge of the worship ofthe true God, he commanded his companions to destroythe temple, with all its enclosures, by ﬁre.

In that city also he appointed the see of thebishopric of his instructor and bishop, Paulinus. Butas soon as he was baptized, he took care, by the direction of the same Paulinus, to build in the same place alarger and nobler church of stone, in the midst whereofthat same oratory which he had ﬁrst erected should beenclosed. Having, therefore, laid the foundation, hebegan to build the church square, encompassing theformer oratory. But before the wall was raised to theproper height, the wicked assassination of the king leftthat work to be ﬁnished by Oswald his successor. Paulinus, for the space of six years from that time, that is,till the end of the reign of that king, by his consent andfavour, preached the word of God in that country, andall that were preordained to eternal life believed andwere baptized. Among whom were Osfrid and Eadfrid,King Edwin’s sons, who were both born to him whilsthe was in banishment, of Quenberga, the daughter ofCearl, king of the Mercians.Afterwards other children of his by Queen Ethelbergawere baptized, viz.

Iﬂi, the son of Osfrid, was also baptized, andmany more noble and illustrious persons. So great wasthen the fervour of the faith, as is reported, and thedesire of the washing of salvation among the nation ofthe Northumbrians, that Paulinus at a certain timecoming with the king and queen to the royal countryseat, which is called Adgefrin, stayed there with themthirty—six days, fully occupied in catechising and baptizing; during which days, from morning till night, hedid fnothing else but instruct the people resorting fromall villages and places, in Christ’s saving word; and wheninstructed, he washed them with the water of absolutionin the river Glen, which is close by. This town, underthe following kings, was abandoned, and another wasbuilt instead of it, at the place called Melmin.These things happened in the province of the Bemicians; but in that of the Deiri also, where he was wontchen to be with the king, he baptized in the river Swale,which runs by the village Cataract; for as yet oratories, or fonts, could not be made in the early infancy ofthe church in those parts. But he built a. church inCampodonum, which afterwards the pagans, by whomKing Edwin was slain, burnt, together with all thetown. In the place of which the later kings built themselves a country-seat in the country called Loidis.

Nor didhe pay any respect to the Christian religion which hadnewly taken root among them; it being to this day thecustom of the Britons not to pay any respect to thefaith and religion of the English, nor to correspond withthem any more than with pagans.

But the kingdom of theBernicians—for into these two provinces the nation ofthe Northumbrians was formerly divided—was possessedby Eanfrid, the son of Ethelfrid, who derived his originfrom the royal family of that province. For all thetime that Edwin reigned, the sons of the aforesaidEthelfrid, who had reigned before him, with many ofthe nobility, lived in banishment among the Scots orPicts, and were there instructed according to the doc—trine of the Scots, and received the grace of baptism.Upon the death of the king, their enemy, they returnedhome, and Eanfrid, as the eldest of them, mentionedabove, became king of the Bernicians. Both thosekings, as soon as they obtained the government of theirearthly kingdoms, renounced and lost the faith of theheavenly kingdom, and again delivered themselves upto be deﬁled by the abominations of their former idols.R</p>

He ﬁrst slewOsric, the next summer, for, being besieged by him in astrong town, he sallied out on a sudden with all hisforces, by surprise, and destroyed him and all his army.After this, for the space of a year, he reigned over theprovinces of the Northumbrians, not like a victoriousking, but like a rapacious and bloody tyrant, and atlength brought to the same end Eanfrid, who unadvisedly came to him with only twelve chosen soldiers,to sue for peace. To this day, that year is looked uponas unhappy, and hateful to all good men; as well onaccount of the apostacy of the English kings, who hadrenounced the faith, as of the outrageous tyranny ofthe British king. Hence it has been agreed by all whohave written about the reigns of the kings, to abolishthe memory of those perﬁdious monarchs, and to assignthat year to the reign of the following king, Oswald, aman beloved by God. This last king, after the death ofhis brother Eanfrid, advanced with an army, small,indeed, in number, but strengthened with the faith ofChrist; and the impious commander of the Britons wasslain, though he had most numerous forces, which heboasted nothing could withstand, at a place in theEnglish tongue called Denises-burn, that is, Denis’sbrook.CHAP.

In that place of prayervery many miraculous cures are known to have beenperformed, as &amp; token and memorial of the king’s faith;for even to this day, many are wont to cut off smallchips of the wood of the holy cross, which being putinto water, men or cattle drinking of, or sprinkled withthat water, are immediately restored to health.The place in the English tongue is called Heavenﬁeld,or the Heavenly Field, which name it formerly receivedas a presage of what was afterwards to happen, denoting,that there the heavenly trophy would be erected, theheavenly victory begun, and heavenly miracles be wroughtto this day.

Nor were they slow ingranting his request; but sent him Bishop Aidan, a; manof singular meekness, piety, and moderation; zealousin the cause of God, though not altogether accordingto knowledge; for he was wont to keep Easter Sundayaccording to the custom of his country, which we havebefore so often mentioned, from the fourteenth to thetwentieth moon; the northern province of the Scots,and all the nation of the Picts, celebrating Easter thenafter that manner, and believing that they therein followed the writings of the holy and praiseworthy FatherAnatolius; the truth of which every skilful person candiscern.

This mannerof keeping Easter continued among them for the spaceof 150 years, till the year of our Lord’s incarnation 715.But then the most reverend and holy father and priest,Egbert, of the English nation, who had long lived inbanishment in Ireland for the sake of Christ, and wasmost learned in the Scriptures, and renowned for longperfection of life, came among them, corrected theirerror, and reduced them to the true and canonical day ofEaster; the which they nevertheless did not always keepon the fourteenth moon With the J ews, as some imagined,but on Sunday, although not in the proper week. For,as Christians, they knew that the resurrection of ourLord, which happened on the ﬁrst day after the Sabbath,was always to be celebrated on the ﬁrst day after theSabbath; but being rude and barbarous, they had notlearned when that same ﬁrst day after the Sabbath,which is now called the Lord’s day, should come. Butbecause they had not laid aside the fervent grace ofcharity, they were worthy to be informed in the trueknowledge of this particular, according to the promise ofthe apostle, saying, “ And if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.” Ofwhich we shall speak more fully in its proper place.CHAP.

He waswont to traverse both town and country on foot, neveron horseback, unless compelled by some urgent necessity; and wheresoever in his way he saw any, eitherrich or poor, he invited them, if inﬁdels, to embrace themystery of the faith; or if they were believers, tostrengthen them in the faith, and to stir them up bywords and actions to alms and good works.His course of life was so different from the slothfulnessof our times, that all those who bore him company,whether they were shorn monks or laymen, were employed in meditation, that is, either in reading the Scriptures, or learning psalms. This was the daily employment of himself and all that were with him, wheresoeverthey went; and if it happened, which was but seldom,that he was invited to eat with the king, he went withone or two clerks, and having taken a small repast, madehaste to be gone with them, either to read or write. Atthat time, many religious men and women, stirred up byhis example, adopted the custom of fasting on Wednesdays and Fridays, till the ninth hour, throughout theyear, except during the ﬁfty days after Easter. Henever gave money to the powerful men of the world, butonly meat, if he happened to entertain them; and, onthe contrary, whatsoever gifts of money he received fromthe rich, he either distributed them, as has been said, tothe use of the poor, or bestowed them in ransoming suchas had been wrongfully sold for slaves.

They,as is testiﬁed, in a great council seriously debated whatwas to be done, being desirous that the nation shouldreceive the salvation it demanded, and grieving that theyhad not received the preacher sent to them. Then saidAidan, who was also present in the council, to the priestthen spoken of, “ I am of opinion, brother, that youwere more severe to your unlearned hearers than youought to have been, and did not at ﬁrst, conformably tothe apostolic rule, give them the milk of more easy doctrine, till being by degrees nourished with the word ofGod, they should be capable of greater perfection, andbe able‘to practise God’s sublimer precepts.” Havingheard these words, all present began diligently to weighwhat he had said, and presently concluded, that he de- served to be made a bishop, and ought to be sent toinstruct the incredulous and unlearned ; since he wasfound to be endued with singular discretion, which is themother of other virtues, and accordingly being ordained,they sent him to their friend, King Oswald, to preach ;and he, as time proved, afterwards appeared to possessall other virtues, as well as the discretion for which hewas before remarkable.CHAP.

The king, observing his erudition and industry,desired him to accept an episcopal see, and stay there ashis bishop. Agilbert complied with the prince’s request,and presided over those people many years. At lengththe king, who understood none but the language of theSaxons, grown weary of that bishop’s barbarous tongue,brought into the province another bishop of his ownnation, whose name was Wini, who had been ordained inFrance; and dividing his province into two dioceses,appointed this last his episcopal see in the city of Winchester, by the Saxons called Vintancestir. Agilbert,being highly offended, that the king should do this without his advice, returned into France, and being madebishop of the city of Paris, died there, aged and full ofdays. Not many years after his departure out of Britain, Wini was also expelled from his bishopric, andtook refuge with Wulfhere, king of the Mercians, ofwhom he purchased for money the see of the city ofLondon, and remained bishop thereof till his death.Thus the province of the ‘Vest Saxons continued nosmall time without a bishop.During which time, the king of that nation, sustain</p>

He, therefore, sent messengers into France to Agilbert, humbly entreating him toreturn to the bishopric of his nation. But he excusedhimself, and afﬁrmed that he could not go, because hewas tied to the bishopric of his own city; however, thathe might not seem to refuse him assistance, he sent inhis stead thither the priest Eleutherius, his nephew, who,if he thought ﬁt, might be ordained his bishop, saying,“ He thought him worthy of a. bishopric.” The king andthe people received him honourably, and entreated Theodore, then archbishop of Canterbury, to consecratehim their bishop.

Thebody of this venerable virgin and bride of Christ wasburied in the church of the blessed protomartyr, Stephen.It was thought ﬁt, three days after, to take up the stonethat covered the grave, and to raise it higher in thesame place, which whilst they were doing, so great afragrancy of perfume rose from below, that it seemed toall the brothers and sisters there present, as if a storeof the richest balsams had been opened.Her aunt also, Ethelberga above mentioned, preservedthe glory so pleasing to God, of perpetual virginity, ingreat continency of body, but the extent of her virtuebecame more conspicuous after her death. Whilst shewas abbess, she began to build in her monastery a church,in honour of all the apostles, wherein she desired herbody might be buried; but when that work was advancedhalf way, she was prevented by death from ﬁnishing it,and buried in the very place of the church where she haddesired. After her death, the brothers occupied themselves with other things, and this structure was intermitted for seven years, at the expiration whereof theyresolved, by reason of the greatness of the work, whollyto lay aside the building of the church, but to removethe abbess’s bones from thence to some other churchthat was ﬁnished and consecrated; but, on opening hertomb, they found the body as free from decay as it hadbeen from the corruption of carnal concupiscence, andhaving washed it again and put on it other clothes, theyremoved the same to the church of St. Stephen, Martyr,whose nativity (or commemoration—day) is celebratedwith much magniﬁcence on the 7th of J uly.</p>

After whichperiod, Oswald was killed in a great battle, by the samepagan nation and pagan king of the Mercians, by whomhis predecessor Edwin had been slain, at a place calledin the English tongue Maserﬁeld, in the thirty-eighthyear of his age, on the 5th day of the month ofAugust.How great his faith was towards God, and how remarkable his devotion, has been made evident by miraclessince his death ; for in the place where he was killed bythe pagans, ﬁghting for his country, inﬁrm men andcattle are healed to this day. Whereupon many tookup the very dust of the place where his body fell, andputting it into water, thereby did much good to theirfriends who were sick. This custom came so muchinto use, that the earth being carried away by degrees,there remained a hole as deep as the height of a man.Nor is it to be wondered that the sick should be healedin the place where he died; for, whilst he lived, henever ceased to provide for the poor and inﬁrm, and tobestow alme on them and assist them.

At length,after much rolling about in extreme anguish, the horsehappened to come to the very place where the aforesaidking died. Immediately the pain ceased, the beastgave over his struggles, and, as is usual with tired cattle,turned gently from side to side, and then starting up,perfectly recovered, began to graze on the green herbage,which the man observing, being an ingenious person, heconcluded there must be some wonderful sanctity in theplace where the horse had been healed, and left a markthere, that he might know the spot again. After whichhe again mounted his horse, and repaired to the innwhere he intended to stop. On his arrival he found a.girl, niece to the landlord, who had long languishedunder a palsy; and when the friends of the family, inhis presence, lamented the girl’s calamity, he gave theman account of the place where his horse had been cured.In short, she was put into a cart and carried and laiddown at the place. At ﬁrst she slept awhile, and whenshe awaked found herself healed of her inﬁrmity.Upon which she called for water, washed her face,put up her hair, and dressed her head, and returnedhome on foot, in good health, with those who hadbrought her.T2</p>

The brother that came from thence, andtold me this, added, that at the time when he wastalking with me, the young man was then still living inthe monastery, on whom, when a boy, that miraculouscure had been wrought. Nor is it to be wondered thatthe prayers of that king, who was then reigning withour Lord, should be very efﬁcacious with him, since he,whilst yet governing his temporal kingdom, was alsowont to pray and take more pains for that which iseternal. In short, it is reported, that he often continuedin prayer from the hour of morning thanksgiving till itwas day; and that by reason of his constant custom ofpraying or giving thanks to God, he was wont always,wherever he sat, to hold his hands turned up on hisknees. It is also given out, and become a proverb,“ That he ended his life in prayer ;” for when he wasbeset with weapons and enemies, he perceived he mustbe immediately killed, and prayed to God for the soulsof his army. Whence it is proverbially said, “ Lordhave mercy on their souls, said Oswald, as he fell tothe ground." His bones, therefore, were translated tothe monastery which we have mentioned, and buriedtherein: but the king that slew him, commanded hishead, hands, and arms to be cut off from the body, andset upon stakes. But his successor in the throne,Oswy, coming thither the next year with his army, tookthem down, and buried his head in the church of Lindisfame; and the hands and arms in his royal city.</p>

In hisplace, Archbishop Honorius ordained Ithamar, of theKentish nation, but not inferior to his predecessors forlearning and conduct of life.Oswy, during the ﬁrst part of his reign, had a partnerin this royal dignity called Oswin, of the race of KingEdwin, and son to Osric, of whom we have spoken above,a man of wonderful piety and devotion, who governed theprovince of the Deiri seven years in very great prosperity, and was himself beloved by all men. But Oswy,who governed all the other northern part of' the nationbeyond the Humber, that is, the province of the Bemicians, could not live at peace with him; but on the contrary, the causes of their disagreement being heightened,he murdered him most cruelly. For when they hadraised armies against one another, Oswin perceived thathe could not maintain a war against one who hadmore auxiliaries than himself, and he thought it betterat that time to lay aside all thoughts of engaging, andto preserve himself for better times. He therefore dismissed the army which he had assembled, and orderedall his men to return to their own homes, from the placethat is called Wilfares—dun, that is, Wilfar’s Hill, whichis almost ten miles distant from the village called Cataract, towards the north—west.

But, alas! itwas otherwise; for the earl betrayed him, and Oswy,in a. detestable manner, by the hands of his commander,Ethilwin, slew him and the soldier aforesaid. This happened on the 20th of August, in the ninth year of hisreign, at a place called Ingethlingum, where afterwards,to atone for this crime, a monastery was built, whereinprayers were to be daily oﬂ'ered up to God for the soulsof both kings, that is, of him that was murdered, and ofhim that commanded him to be killed.King Oswin was of a. graceful aspect, and tall of stature, affable in discourse, and courteous in behaviour;and most bountiful, as well to the ignoble as the noble;so that he was beloved by all men for his qualities ofbody and mind, and persons of the ﬁrst rank came fromalmost all provinces to serve him. Among other virtuesand rare endowments, if I may so express it, humility issaid to have been the greatest, which it will sufﬁce toprove by one example.He had given an extraordinarily ﬁne horse to BishopAidan, which he might either use in crossing rivers, orin performing a journey upon any urgent necessity,though he was wont to travel ordinarily on foot.

Had not we many other horsesof less value, and of other sorts, which would have beengood enough to give to the poor, and not to give thathorse, which I had particularly chosen for yourself?”</p>

Then, on a sudden, whilst hewas warming himself, calling to mind what the bishop hadsaid to him, he ungirt his sword, and gave it to a servant,and in a hasty manner fell down at the bishop’s feet,beseeching him to forgive him; “ For from this time forward,” said he, “ I will never speak any more of this,nor will I judge of what, or how much of our money youshall give to the sons of God.” The bishop was muchmoved at this sight, and starting up, raised him, saying,“ He was entirely reconciled to him, if he would sit downto his meat, and lay aside all sorrow.” The king, at thebishop’s command and request, beginning to be merry,the bishop, on the other hand, grew so melancholy as toshed tears. His priest then asking him in the languageof his country, which the king and his servants did notunderstand, why he wept, “ I know,” said he, “ thatthe king will not live long; for I never before saw a.humble king; whence I conclude that he will soon besnatched out of this life, because this nation is not worthyof such a ruler.” Not long after, the bishop’s predictionwas fulﬁlled by the king’s death, as has been said above.But Bishop Aidan himself was also taken out of thisworld, twelve days after the king he loved, on the 3lstof August, to receive the eternal reward of his laboursfrom our Lord.CHAP.

A certain priest, whose name was Utta, &amp;man of great gravity and sincerity, and on that accounthonoured by all men, even the princes of the world,being ordered to Kent, to bring from thence, as wife forKing Oswy, Eanﬂeda, the daughter of King Edwin, whohad been carried thither when her father was killed; andintending to go thither by land, but to return with thevirgin by sea, repaired to Bishop Aidan, entreating himto offer up his prayers to our Lord for him and his company, who were then to set out on their journey. He,blessing and recommending them to our Lord, at thesame time gave them some holy oil, saying, “I know thatwhen you go abroad, you will meet with a_ storm andcontrary wind; but do you remember to cast this oil Igive you into the sea, and the wind shall cease immediately, you will have pleasant calm weather, and returnhome safe.”All which fell out asthe bishop had predicted. For inthe ﬁrst place, the winds raging, the sailors endeavouredto ride it out at anchor, but all to no purpose; for thesea breaking in on all sides, and the ship beginning to beﬁlled with water, they all concluded that certain deathwas at hand; the priest at last remembering the bishop’swords, laid hold of the phia] and cast some of the oilinto the sea, which, as had been foretold, became presently calm.

Which miracle was not told me bya. person of little credit, but by Cynemund, a most faithful priest of our church, who declared that it was relatedto him by Utta, the priest, on and by whom the samewas wrought.</p>

Not being able to enter it by force,or by a long siege, he endeavoured to burn it; andhaving destroyed all the villages in the neighbourhood ofthe city, he brought to it an immense quantity of planks,beams, wattles and thatch, wherewith he encompassedthe place to a great height on the land side, and whenthe wind set upon it, ﬁring the mass, designed to bumthe town.At that time, the most reverend Bishop Aidan residedin the isle of Fame, .which is nearly two miles from thecity; for thither he was wont "often to retire to prayin private, that he might be undisturbed. Indeed, thissolitary residence of his is to this day shown in thatisland. When he saw the ﬂames of ﬁre and the smokecarried by the boisterous wind above the city walls, heis reported, with eyes and hands lifted up to heaven, tohave said, “ Behold, Lord, how great mischief Pendadoes!” Which words were hardly uttered, when thewind immediately turning from the city, drove back theﬂames upon those who had kindled them, so that somebeing hurt, and all frightened, they forbore any furtherattempts against the city, which they perceived was protected by the hand of God.</p>

XVII.—HOW THE POST OF THE CHURCH ON WHICHBISHOP AIDAN WAS LEANING WHEN HE DIED, COULD NOTBE BURNT WHEN THE REST OF THE CHURCH WAS CONSUMEDBY FIRE; AND OF HIS INWARD LIFE.AIDAN was in the king’s country—house, not far from 3:21:33the city of which we have spoken above, at the time A.n.651.when death separated him from his body, after he hadbeen bishop sixteen years; for having a church and a.chamber there, he was wont often to go and stay there,and to make excursions to preach in the country roundabout, which he likewise did at other of the king’scountry-seats, having nothing of his own besides hischurch and a few ﬁelds about it. When he was sickthey set up a tent for him close to the wall at the westend of the church, by which means it happened that hegave up the ghost, leaning against a. post that was onthe outside to strengthen the wall. He died in theseventeenth year of his episcopacy, the last day of themonth of August. His body was thence translatedto the isle of Lindisfarne, and buried in the churchyardbelonging to the brethren. Some time after, when alarger church was built there, and dedicated in honourof the most blessed prince of the apostles, his boneswere translated thither, and deposited on the righthand of the altar, with the respect due to so great aprelate.Finan, who had likewise come from the same monas- c1335: nuctery of Hii in the Scottish island, succeeded him, and 'continued a. considerable time in the bishopric. Ithappened some years after, that Penda, king of theMercians, coming into these parts with a. hostilearmy, destroyed all he could with ﬁre and sword, andburned down the village and church above mentioned,where the bishop died; but it fell out in a. wonderfulmanner that the post, which he had leaned upon when.</p>

This miracle being taken notice of,the church was soon rebuilt in the same place, and thatvery post was set up on the outside, as it had beenbefore, to strengthen the wall. It happened again,some time after, that the same village and church wereburned down the second time, and even then the ﬁrecould not touch that post; and when in a most miraculous manner the ﬁre broke through the very holes init wherewith it was ﬁxed to the building, and destroyedthe church, yet it could do no hurt to the said post.The church being therefore built there the third time,they did not, as before, place that post on the outsideas a support, but within, as a memorial of the miracle;and the people coming in were wont to kneel there, andimplore the Divine mercy. And it is manifest thatsince then many have been healed in that same place, asalso that chips being cut oﬁ' from that post, and putinto water, have healed many from their distempers.I have written thus much concerning the person and Aidan'allfe.works of the aforesaid Aidan, in no way commending orapproving what he imperfectly understood in relation tothe observance of Easter; nay, very much detestingthe same, as I haVe most manifestly proved in the bookI have written, “ De Temporibus;” but, like an impartial historian, relating what was done by or withhim, and commending such things as are praiseworthyin his actions, and preserving the memory thereof forthe beneﬁt of the readers; viz. his love of peace andcharity; his continence and humility; his mind superiorto anger and avarice, and despising pride and vainglory ;his industry in keeping and teaching the heavenlycommandments ; his diligence in reading and watching;his authority becoming a priest in reproving the haughtyand powerful, and at the same time his tenderness incomforting the afﬂicted, and relieving or defending thepoor.

Yet this I approve in him, that in the celebration of his Easter, the object which he had in viewin all he said, did, or preached, was the same as ours,that is, the redemption of mankind, through the passion, resurrection and ascension into heaven of the manJesus Christ, who is the Mediator betwixt God andman. And therefore he always celebrated the same,not as some falsely imagine, on the fourteenth moon,like the J ews, whatsoever the day was, but on the Lord’sday, from the fourteenth to the twentieth moon; andthis he did from his belief of the resurrection of ourLord happening on the day after the Sabbath, and forthe hope of our resurrection, which also he, with theholy Church, believed would happen on the. same dayafter the Sabbath, now called the Lord’s day.CHAP.

On cominginto the province of the East Saxons, he was honourablyreceived by the aforesaid king, and performing his usualemployment of preaching the Gospel, by the exampleof his virtue and the eﬁcacy of his discourse, convertedmany unbelievers to Christ, and conﬁrmed in his faithand love those that already believed.Here he fell into some inﬁrmity of body, and wasthought worthy to see a vision from God; in whichhe was admonished diligently to proceed in the ministryof the word which he had undertaken, and indefatigablyto continue his usual watching and prayers; inasmuchas his end was certain, but the hour of it would beuncertain, according to the saying of our Lord, “ Watchye therefore, because ye know not the day nor thehour.” Being conﬁrmed by this vision, he applied himself with all speed to build a monastery on the groundwhich had been given him by King Sigebert, and toestablish regular discipline therein. This monasterywas pleasantly situated in the woods, and with thesea not far off ; it was built within the area of a castle,which in the English language is called Cnobheresburg,that is, Cnobher’s Town; afterwards, Anna, king of thatprovince, and the nobility, embellished it with morestately buildings and donations.

Beingrestored to his body at that time, and again taken fromit three days after, he not only saw the greater joysof the blessed, but also extraordinary combats of evilspirits, who by frequent accusations wickedly endeavoured to obstruct his journey to heaven; but theangels protecting him, all their endeavours were in vain.Concerning which particulars, if any one desires to bemore fully informed, that is, with what subtle fraud thedevils represented both his actions and superﬂuouswords, and even his thoughts, as if they had beenwritten down in a book ; and what pleasing or disagreeable things he was informed of by the angels and saints,or just men who appeared to him among the angels; lethim read the little book of his life which I have mentioned, and I believe he will thereby reap much spiritualproﬁt.But there is one thing among the rest, which we havethought may be beneficia.] to many if inserted in thishistory. When he had been lifted up on high, he wasordered by the angels that conducted him to look backupon the world. Upon which, casting his eyes downward, he saw, as it were, a dark and obscure valleyunderneath him. He also saw four ﬁres in the air, notfar distant from each other. Then asking the angels,what ﬁres those were? he was told, they were the ﬁreswhich would kindle and consume the world. One ofthem was of falsehood, when we do not fulﬁl that whichwe promised in baptism, to renounce the Devil and allhis works.

These ﬁres, A'D'W'increasing by degrees, extended so as to meet oneanother, and being joined, became an immense ﬂame.When it drew near, fearing for himself, he said to theangel, “Lord, behold the ﬁre draws near me.” Theangel answered, “That which you did not kindle shallnot burn you; for though this appears to be a terribleand great ﬁre, yet it tries every man according to themerits of his works; for every man‘s concupiscenceshall burn in the ﬁre; for as every one burns in the bodythrough unlawful pleasure, so when discharged of thebody, he shall burn in the punishment which he hasdeserved."Then he saw one of the three angels, who had beenhis conductors thoughout both visions, go before anddivide the ﬂame of ﬁre, whilst the other two, ﬂying abouton both sides, defended him from the danger of that ﬁre.He also saw devils ﬂying through the ﬁre, raising conﬂa—grations of wars against the just. Then followed accusations of the wicked spirits against him, the defence ofthe good angels in his favour, and a more extended viewof the heavenly troops; as also of holy men of hisown nation, whom he had long since been informed tohave been deservedly advanced to the degree of priesthood, from whom he heard many things that mightbe very salutary to himself, or to all others that wouldlisten to them. When they had ended their discourse,and returned to heaven with the angelic spirits, thethree angels remained with the blessed Fursey, of whomwe have spoken before, and who were to bring him backto his body. And when they approached the aforesaid'immense ﬁre, the angel divided the ﬂame, as he haddone before; but when the man of God came to thepassage so opened amidst the ﬂames, the unclean spirits,laying hold of one of those whom they tormented in theﬁre, threw him at him, and touching his shoulder and</p>

But as for the matter of his visions,he would only relate them to those who, from holy zealand desire of reformation, wished to learn the same.An ancient brother of our monastery is still living, whois wont to declare that a very sincere and religious mantold him, that he had seen Fursey himself in the province of the East Angles, and heard those visions fromhis mouth.

These things being rightly performed, he became desirous to rid himself of all businessof this world, and even of the monastery itself, andforthwith left the same, and the care of souls, to hisbrother Fullan, and the priests Gobban and Dicull, andbeing himself free from all that was worldly, resolved toend his life as a hermit. He had another brother calledUltan, who, after a long monastical probation, had alsoadopted the life of an anchorite. Repairing all alone tohim, he lived a. whole year with him in continence andprayer, and laboured daily with his hands.Afterwards seeing the province in confusion, by theirruptione of the pagans, and presaging that the monasteries would be also in danger, he left all things in order,and sailed over into France, and being there honourablyentertained by Clovis, king of the Franks, or by thepatrician Erconwald, he built a monastery in the placecalled Latiniacum; and falling sick not long after, departed this life. The same Erconwald took his body,and deposited it in the porch of a church he was buildingin his town of Peronne, till the church itself should bededicated. This happened twenty-seven days after, andthe body being taken from the porch to be reburied nearthe altar, was found as entire as if he had just thendied. And again, four years after, a more decent tabernacle or chapel being built for the same body to theeastward of the altar, it was still found free from cor—ruption, and translated thither with due honour; whereit is well known that his merits, through the Divineoperation, have been declared by many miracles. Thesethings, and the incorruption of his body, we have takennotice of, that the sublimeness of this man may be thebetter known to the readers. All which, whosoever will</p>

When he heard the preaching of truth, thepromise of the heavenly kingdom, and the hope of resurrection and future immortality, he declared that hewould willingly become a Christian, even though heshould be refused the virgin; being chieﬂy prevailed onto receive the faith by King Oswy’s son Alfrid, who washis relation and friend, and had married his sister Cyneberga, the daughter of King Penda,.Accordingly he was baptized by Bishop Finan, withall his earls and soldiers, and their servants that camealong with him, at a noted village belonging to the king,called At the Wall. And having received four priests,who for their erudition and good life were deemed properto instruct and baptize his nation, he returned homewith much joy. These priests were Cedda and Adda,and Betti and Diuma; the last of whom was by nationa Scot, the others English. Adda was brother to Utta,whom we have mentioned before, a renowned priest, andabbot of the monastery of Gateshead. The aforesaidpriests, arriving in the province with the prince, preachedthe word, and were willingly listened to; and many, aswell of the nobility as the common sort, renouncing theabominations of idolatry, were baptized daily. Nor didKing Penda obstruct the preaching of the word amonghis people, the Mercians, if any were willing to hear it;but, on the contrary, he hated and despised those whomhe perceived not to perform the works of faith, whenthey had received the faith of Christ, saying, “ Theywere contemptible and wretched who did not obey theirGod, in whom they believed.” This was begun twoyears before the death of King Penda.But when he was slain, and Oswy, the most Christianking, succeeded him in the throne, Diuma, one of theaforesaid four priests, was made bishop of the MidlandAngles, as also of the Mercians, being ordained byBishop Finan; for the scarcity of priests was the occaY</p>

King Oswy havingoften, in a friendly and brotherly manner, said this andmuch more to the like effect, at length, with the consentof his friends, he believed, and after consulting withthose about him, and exhorting them, they all agreedand gave their approbation, and were baptized with himby Bishop Finan, in the king’s village above spoken of,which is called At the Wall, because it is close by thewall with which the Romans formerly divided the islandof Britain, at the distance of twelve miles from theeastern sea.King Sigebert, being now become a citizen of theeternal kingdom, returned to the seat of his temporalkingdom, requesting of Oswy that he would give himsome teachers, who might convert his nation to thefaith of Christ, and baptize them. Oswy, accordingly,sending into the province of the Midland Angles, invitedto him the man of God, Cedd, and giving him anotherpriest for his companion, sent them to preach to theEast Saxons. When these two, travelling to all partsof that country, had gathered a. numerous church toour Lord, it happened that Cedd returned home, andcame to the church of Lindisfarne to confer with BishopFinan; who, ﬁnding how successful he had been in thework of the Gospel, made him bishop of the church ofthe East Saxons, calling to him two other bishops toassist at the ordination. Cedd, having received theepiscopal dignity, returned to his province, and pursuingthe work he had begun with more ample authority, builtchurches in several places,- ordaining priests and deaconsto assist him in the work of the faith, and the ministryof baptizing, especially in the city which, in the language of the Saxons, is called Ithancestir, as also inthat which is named Tilaburg; the ﬁrst of which placesis on the bank of the river Pente, the other on the bankof the Thames, where, gathering a ﬂock of servants of</p>

They were two brotherswho did this' wicked deed; and being asked what hadmoved them to it, had nothing else to answer, but thatthey had been incensed against the king, and hatedhim, because he was too apt to spare his enemies, andeasily to forgive the wrongs they had done him, upontheir entreaty. Such was the crime for which the kingwas killed, because he observed the precepts of theGospel with a devout heart; in which innocent death,4 however, his real oﬁ'ence was also punished, according tothe prediction of the man of God. For one of thoseearls that murdered him was unlawfully married, whichthe bishop not being able to prevent or correct, heexcommunicated him, and commanded all that wouldgive ear to him not to enter within his house, nor to eatof his meat. The king made slight of this inhibition,and being invited by the earl, went to an entertainmentat his house, and when he was going thence, the bishopmet him. The king beholding him, immediately dismounted from his horse, trembling, and fell down at hisfeet, begging pardon for his offence; for the bishop, whowas likewise on horseback, had also alighted. Beingmuch‘ incensed, he touched the king lying in thathumble posture, with the rod he held in his hand, andusing his pontiﬁcal authority, spoke thus: “I say toyou, forasmuch as you would not refrain from the houseof that wicked and condemned person, you shall die inthat very house.” Yet it is to be believed, that such adeath of a religious man not only blotted out his offence,but also added to his merit ; because it happened on account of his pious observance of the commands of Christ.Sigebert was succeeded in the kingdom by Suidhelm,</p>

After thishe gave battle with a very small army against superiorforces : indeed, it is reported that the pagans had threetimes the number of men; for they had thirty legions,led on by most noted commanders. King Oswy and hisson Alfrid met them with a very small army, as has beensaid, but conﬁding in the' conduct of Christ; his otherson, ngrid, was then kept an hostage at the court ofQueen Cynwise, in the province of the Mercians. KingOswald’s son Ethelwald, who ought to have assistedthem, was on the enemy’s side, and led them on to ﬁghtagainst his country and uncle ; though, during thebattle, he withdrew, and waited the event in a place ofsafety. The engagement beginning, the pagans were defeated, the thirty commanders, and those who had come tohis assistance, were put to ﬂight, and almost all of themslain; among whom was Ethelhere, brother and successor to Anna, king of the East Angles, who had been theoccasion of the war, and who was now killed, with all hissoldiers. The battle was fought near the river Vinwed,which then, with the great rains, had , not only ﬁlled itschannel, but overﬂowed its banks, so that many morewere drowned in the ﬂight than destroyed by the sword.Then King Oswy, pursuant to the vow he had madeto our Lord, returned thanks to God for the victory,and gave his daughter Elﬂeda, who was scarce a year old,to be consecrated to him in perpetual virginity; delivering also twelve small portions of land, wherein earthlywarfare should cease, and in which there should be a.perpetual residence and subsistence for monks to followthe warfare which is spiritual, and pray diligently for the</p>

Each of the said possessions contained tenfamilies, that is, a hundred and twenty in all.

In that same monastery, she and her father, Oswy, her mother, Eanﬂeda,her mother’s father, Edwin, and many other noble persons, are buried in the church of the holy Apostle Peter.King Oswy concluded the aforesaidwar in the country ofLoidis, in the thirteenth year of his reign, on the 15thof November, to the great beneﬁt of both nations; forhe both delivered his own people from the hostile depredations of the pagans, and, having cut off the wickedking’s head, converted the Mercians and the adjacentprovinces to the grace of the Christian faith.Diuma was made the ﬁrst bishop of the Mercians, asalso of Lindisfarne and the Midland Angles, as has beensaid above, and he died and was buried among the Midland Angles.

The same King Oswy governed the Mercians, as also the people of the other southern provinces,three years after he had slain King Penda; and he likewise subdued the greater part of the Picts to the dominion of the English.At which time he gave to the above-mentioned Peada,son to King Penda, who was his kinsman, the kingdomof the Southern Mercians, consisting, as is reported, of5,000 families, divided by the river Trent from theNorthern Marciane, whose land contained 7,000 families;but that Peada was the next spring very wickedly killed,by the treachery, as is said, of his wife, during the verytime of celebrating Easter. Three years after the deathof King Penda, Immin, and Eafa, and Eadbert, generalsof the Mercians, rebelled against King Oswy, setting upfor their king, Wulfhere, son to the said Penda, ayouth, whom they had kept concealed; and expelling theoﬂicers of the foreign king, they at once recovered theirliberty and their lands; and being thus free, togetherwith their king, they rejoiced to serve Christ the trueKing, that they might obtain the everlasting kingdomwhich is in heaven.

Eadbert, also bishopof that place, took of? the thatch, and covered it, bothroof and walls, with plates of lead.At this time, a. great and frequent controversy happened about the observance of Easter; those that camefrom Kent or France afﬁrming, that the Scots keptEaster Sunday contrary to the custom of the universalchurch. Among them was a most zealous defender ofthe true Easter, whose name was Roman, a. Scot bynation, but instructed in ecclesiastical truth, either inFrance or Italy, who, disputing with Finan, convincedmany, or at least induced them to make a. more strictinquiry after the truth; yet he could not prevail uponFinan, but, on the contrary, made him the more inveterate by reproof, and a professed opposer of the truth,being of a hot and violent temper. J ames, formerly thedeacon of the venerable Archbishop Paulinus, as hasbeen said above, kept the true and Catholic Easter, withall those that he could persuade to adopt the right way.Queen Eanﬂeda and her followers also observed the sameas she had seen Practised in Kent, having with her aKentish priest that followed the Catholic mode, whosename was Romanus.

This diﬂ’er—ence about the observance of Easter, whilst Aidan lived,was patiently tolerated by all men, as being sensible,that though he could not keep Easter contrary to thecustom of those who had sent him, yet he industriouslylaboured to practise all works of faith, piety, and love,according to the custom of all holy men; for whichreason he was deservedly beloved by all, even by thosewho differed in opinion concerning Easter, and was heldin veneration, not only by indifferent persons, but evenby the bishops, Honorius of Canterbury, and Felix ofthe East Angles.But after the death of Finan, who succeeded him, 3:523;when Colman, who was also sent out of Scotland, came A-D- 661to be bishop, a greater controversy arose about theobservance of Easter, and the rules of ecclesiastical life.Whereupon this dispute began naturally to inﬂuencethe thoughts and hearts of many, who feared, lest havingreceived the name of Christians, they might happen torun, or to have run, in vain. This reached the ears ofKing Oswy and his son Alfrid; for Oswy, having beeninstructed and baptized by the Scots, and being veryperfectly skilled in their language, thought nothing betterthan what they taught. But Alfrid, having been instructed in Christianity by Wilfrid, a most learned man,who had ﬁrst gone to Rome to learn the ecclesiasticaldoctrine, and spent much time at Lyons with Dalﬁn,archbishop of France, from whom also he had receivedthe ecclesiastical tonsure, rightly thought this man’sdoctrine ought to be preferred before all the traditionsof the Scots. For this reason he had also given him amonastery of forty families, at a place called Rhypum;which place, not long before, he had given to those thatfollowed the system of the Scots for a monastery; butforasmuch as they afterwards, being left to their choice,prepared to quit the place rather than alter their opinion,</p>

The kings, both father and son, came thither,the bishops Colman, with his Scottish clerks, and Agilbert, with the priests Agatha and Wilfrid, and Jamesand Romanus, were on their side; the Abbess Hildaand her followers were for the Scots, as was also thevenerable Bishop Cedd, long before ordained by theScots, as has been said above, and he was in that council3. most careful interpreter for both parties.King Oswy ﬁrst observed, that it behoved those whoserved one God to observe the same rule of life; and asthey all expected the same kingdom in heaven, so theyought not to diﬁ'er in the celebration of the Divine mysteries; but rather to inquire which was the truest tradition, that the same might be followed by all; he thencommanded his bishop, Colman, ﬁrst to declare what thecustom was, which he observed, and whence it derivedits origin. Then Colman said, “ The Easter which Ikeep, I received from my elders, who sent me bishophither; all our forefathers, men beloved of God, areknown to have kept it after the same manner; and thatthe same may not seem to any contemptible or worthyto be rejected, it is the same which St. J ohn the Evangelist, the disciple beloved of our Lord, with all the</p>

Quo hæc et his similia dicente,jussit rex et Agilbertum proferre in medium morem suæobservationis, unde initium haberet, vel qua hunc auctoritate sequeretur.

Agilbert answered, “ I desire that my disciple, the priest Wilfrid, may speak inmy stead; because we both concur with the other followers of the ecclesiastical tradition, that are here present, and he can better explain our opinion in theEnglish language, than I can by an interpreter.”Then Wilfrid, being ordered by the king to speak,delivered himself thus :—“ The Easter which we observe,we saw celebrated by all at Rome, where the blessedapostles, Peter and Paul, lived, taught, suffered, and wereburied; we saw the same done in Italy and in France,when we travelled through those countries for pilgrimageand prayer. We found the same practised in Africa,Asia, Egypt, Greece, and all the world, wherever thechurch of Christ is spread abroad, through severalnations and tongues, at one and the same time; exceptonly these and their accomplices in obstinacy, I meanA.D. 664.ControversybetweenColman andWilfrid.the Picts and the Britons, who foolishly, in these two .remote islands of the world, and only in part even ofthem, oppose all the rest of the universe.” When hehad so said, Colman answered, “ It is strange that you willcall our labours foolish, wherein we follow the example ofso great an apostle, who was thought worthy to lay his headon our Lord’s bosom, when all the world knows him tohave lived most wisely.” Wilfrid replied, “ Far be it fromus to charge John with folly, for he literally observedthe precepts of the J ewish law, whilst the church stillJ udaized in many points, and the apostles were not ableat once to cast oﬁ' all the Observances of the law whichhad been instituted by God. In which way it is necessary that all who come to the faith should forsake theidols which were invented by devils, that they might notgive scandal to the J ews that were among the Gentiles.</p>

In. c. xxv.] ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY. 369For this reason it was, that Paul circumcised Timothy, A.D. 664.that he offered sacriﬁce in the temple, that he shaved hishead with Aquila and Priscilla at Corinth; for no otheradvantage than to avoid giving scandal to the Jews.Hence it was, that J ames said, to the same Paul, ‘ Yousee, brother, how many thousands of the J ews havebelieved; and they are all zealous for the law. Andyet, at this time, the Gospel spreading throughout theworld, it is needless, nay, it is not lawful, for the faithfuleither to be circumcised, or to offer up to God sacriﬁcesof ﬂesh.’ So J ohn, pursuant to the custom of the law,began the celebration of the feast of Easter, on thefourteenth day of the ﬁrst month, in the evening, notregarding whether the same happened on a Saturday, orany other day. But when Peter preached at Rome,beng mindful that our Lord arose from the dead, andgave the world the hopes of resurrection, on theﬁrstday after the Sabbath, he understood that Easter oughtto be observed, so as always to stay till the rising of themoon on the fourteenth day of the ﬁrst moon, in theevening, according to the custom and precepts of thelaw, even as John did. And when that came, if theLord’s day, then called the ﬁrst day after the Sabbath,was the next day, he began that very evening to keepEaster, as we all do at this day. But if the Lord’s daydid not fall the next morning after the fourteenth moon,but on the sixteenth, or the seventeenth, or any othermoon. till the twenty—ﬁrst, he waited for that, and on theSaturday before, in the evening, began to observe theholy solemnity of Easter. Thus it came to pass, thatEaster Sunday was only kept from the ﬁfteenth moon tothe twenty-ﬁrst. Nor does this evangelical and apos—tolic tradition abolish the law, but rather fulﬁl it; thecommand being to keep the passover from the fourteenthmoon of the ﬁrst month in the evening to the twentyﬁrst moon of the same month in the evening; whichobservance all the successors of St. J ohn in Asia, since</p>

For J ohn, keeping the Paschaltime according to the degree of the Mosaic law, had noregard to the ﬁrst day after the Sabbath, which you donot practise, who celebrate Easter only on the ﬁrst dayafter the Sabbath. Peter kept Easter Sunday betweenthe ﬁfteenth and the twenty-ﬁrst moon, Which you donot, but keep Easter Sunday from the fourteenth to thetwentieth moon ; so that you often begin Easter on thethirteenth moon in the evening, whereof neither the lawmade any mention, nor did our Lord, the author andgiver of the Gospel, on that day, but on the fourteenth,either eat the old passover in the evening, or deliver thesacraments of the New Testament, to be celebrated bythe church,‘ in memory of his passion. Besides, in yourcelebration of Easter, you utterly exclude the twentyﬁrst moon, which the. law ordered to be principally observed. Thus, as I said before, you agree neither withJ ohn nor Peter, nor with the law, nor the Gospel, in thecelebration of the greatest festival.”To this Colman rejoined : “ Did Anatolius, a holyman, and much commended in church history, act contrary to the law and the Gospel, when he wrote, thatEaster was to be celebrated from the fourteenth to thetwentieth? Is it to be believed that our most reverendFather Columba and his successors, men beloved byGod, who kept Easter after the same manner, thoughtor acted contrary to the Divine writings? Whereasthere were many among them, whose sanctity is testiﬁed</p>

Illeenim in Pascha suo, regulam utique veritatis sequens, circulum decem et novem annorum posuit, quem vos aut ignoratis, aut agnitum et a. tota. Christi eeclesia custoditum pronihilo contemnitis. Ille sic in Pascha Dominico quartamdecimam lunam computavit, ut hanc eadem ipsa die, moreEgyptiorum, quintam decimam lunam ad vesperam essefateretur. Sic idem vicesimam die Dominico Paschaeannotavit, ut hanc, declinata eadem die, esse vicesimamprimam crederet.

For he, following the rule of truth in hisEaster, appointed a revolution of nineteen years, whicheither you are ignorant of, or if you know it, though itis kept by the whole church of Christ, yet you despiseit. He so computed the fourteenth moon in theEaster of our Lord, that according to the custom ofthe Egyptians, he acknowledged it to be the ﬁfteenthmoon in the evening ; so in like manner be assigned thetwentieth to Easter-Sunday, as believing that to be thetwenty-ﬁrst moon, when the sun had set, which rule anddistinction of his it appears you are ignorant of, in thatyou sometimes keep Easter before the full of the moon,that is, on the thirteenth day. Concerning your FatherColumba and his followers, whose sanctity you say youimitate, and whose rules and precepts you observe, whichhave been conﬁrmed by signs from heaven, I may answer,that when many, on the day of judgment, shall say toour Lord, ‘ That in his name they prophesied, and castout devils, and wrought many wonders,’ our Lord willreply, ‘ That he never knew them.’ But far be it fromme, that I say so of your fathers, because it is muchmore just to believe what is good, than what is evil, ofpersons whom one does not know. Wherefore I do notdeny those to have been God’s servants, and beloved byhim, who with rustic simplicity, but pious intentions,have themselves loved him. Nor do I think that suchkeeping of Easter was very prejudicial to them, as longas none came to show them a more perfect rule; andyet I do believe that they, if any catholic adviser hadcome among them, would have as readily followed hisA AI</p>

And if that Columba of yours, (and, I maysay, ours also, if he was Christ’s servant,) was a holyman and powerful in miracles, yet could he be preferredbefore the most blessed prince of the apostles, to whomour Lord said, ‘Thou art Peter, and upon this rock Iwill build my church, and the gates of hell shall notprevail against it, and to thee I will give the keys of thekingdom of heaven ?' "When Wilfrid had spoken thus, the king said, “ Is ittrue, Colman, that these words were spoken to Peter byour Lord '?" He answered, “ It is true, 0 king !" Thensays he, “ Can you show any such power given to yourColumba ?" Colman answered, “ None.” Then addedthe king, “ Do you both agree, that these words wereprincipally directed to Peter, and that the keys ofheaven were given to him by our Lord?” They bothanswered, “ We do.” Then the king concluded, “ AndI also say unto you, that he is the door—keeper, whom Iwill not contradict, but will, as far as I know 'and amable, in all things obey his decrees, lest, when I cometo the gates of the kingdom of heaven, there should benone to open them, he being my adversary who is provedto have the keys.” The king having said this, allpresent, both great and small, gave their assent, andrenouncing the more imperfect institution, resolved toconform to that which they found to be better.AA2</p>

Cohnan, perceiving that 5133?his doctrine was rejected, and his sect despised, took A.D.634with him such as would not comply With the CatholicEaster and the tonsure, (for there was much controversyabout that also,) and went back into Scotland, to consultwith his people what was to be done in this case. Cedd,forsaking the practices of the Scots, returned to hisbishopric, having submitted to the Catholic observanceof Easter. This disputation happened in the year ofour Lord’s incarnation 664, which was the twentysecond year of the reign-of King Oswy, and the thirtieth of the episcopacy of the Scots among the English;for Aidan was bishop seventeen years, Finan ten, andColman three.When Colman was gone back into his own country,God’s servant, Tuda, was made bishop of the Northumbrians in his place, having been instructed and ordainedbishop among the Southern Scots, having also the ecclesiastical tonsure of his crown, according to the customof that province, and observing the Catholic time ofEaster. He was a good and religious man, but governedhis church a very short time; he came out of Scotlandwhilst Colman was yet bishop, and, both by word andexample, diligently taught all persons those things thatappertain to the faith and truth. But Eata, who wasabbot of the monastery of Melros, a most reverend andmeek man, was appointed abbot over the brethren thatstayed in the church of Lindisfarne, when the Scotswent away; they say, Colman, upon his departure,requested and obtained this of King Oswy, becauseEata was one of Aidan’s twelve boys of the English</p>

Colmancarried home with him part of the bones of the mostreverend Father Aidan, and left part of them in thechurch where he had presided, ordering them to beinterred in the sacristy.The place which he governed shows how frugal heand his predecessors were, for there were very fewhouses besides the church found at their departure;indeed, no more than were barely sufﬁcient for theirdaily residence; they had also no money, but cattle;for if they received any money from rich persons, theyimmediately gave it to the poor; there being no need togather money, or provide houses for the entertainmentof the great men of the world; for such never resortedto the church, except to pray and hear the word of God.The king himself, when opportunity offered, came onlywith ﬁve or six servants, and having performed hisdevotions in the church, departed. But if they happened to take a repast there, they were satisﬁed withonly the plain and daily food of the brethren, and required no more; for the whole care of those teacherswas to serve God, not the world—to feed the soul, andnot the belly.For this reason the religious habit was at that timein great veneration; so that wheresoever any clergymanor monk happened to come, he was joyfully received byall persons, as God’s servant; and if they chanced tomeet him upon the way, they ran to him, and bowing,were glad to be signed with his hand, or blessed withhis mouth. Great attention was also paid to theirexhortations; and on Sundays they ﬂocked eagerly tothe church, or the monasteries, not to feed their bodies,but to hear the word of God; and if any priest hap</p>

To which plaguethe aforesaid priest Tuda fell a victim, and was honourably buried in the monastery of Pegnaleth. This pestilence did no less harm in_ the island of Ireland. Many ofthe nobility, and of the lower ranks of the Englishnation, were there at that time, who, in the days of theBishops Finan and Colman, forsaking their native island,retired thither, either for the sake of Divine studies, orof a more continent life; and some of them presentlydevoted themselves to a monastical life, others choserather to apply themselves to study, going about fromone master’s cell to another.

The former A.D. 664.of which was brother to Ethelwin, a man no less belovedby God, who also afterwards went over into Irelandto study, and having been well instructed, returned intohis own country, and being made bishop in the provinceof Lindsey, long governed that church worthily andcreditably. These two being in the monastery which inthe language of the Scots is called Rathmelsigi, andhaving lost all their companions, who were either cut offby the mortality, or dispersed into other places, fell bothdesperately sick of the same distemper, and were grievously afﬂicted. Of these, Egbert, (as I was informedby a priest venerable for his age, and of great veracity,who declared he had heard those things from his ownmouth,) concluding that he was at the point of death,went out of his chamber, where the sick lay, in themorning, and sitting alone in a convenient place, beganseriously to reﬂect upon his past actions, and, being fullof compunction at the remembrance of his sins, bedewedhis face with tears, and prayed fervently to God that hemight not die yet, before he could make amends for theoffences which he had committed in his infancy andyounger years, or might further exercise himself in goodworks. He also made a vow that he would, for the sakeof God, live in a strange place, so as never to return intothe island of Britain, where he was born; that, besidesthe canonical times of singing psalms, unless preventedby corporeal inﬁrmity, he would say the whole Psalterdaily to the praise of God ; and that he would every weekfast one whole day and a night. Returning home, afterhis tears, prayers and vows, he found his companionasleep, and going to bed himself, began to compose him—self to rest. When he had lain quiet awhile, his comradeawaking, looked on him, and said, “ Alas! BrotherEgbert, what have you done? I was in hopes that weshould have entered together into life everlasting; butknow that what you prayed for is granted.” For he had</p>

He led his life ingreat perfection of humility, meekness, continence, simplicity, and justice. Thus he was a great benefactor,both to his own nation, and to those of the Scots andPicts among whom he lived a stranger, by his exampleof life, his industry in teaching, his authority in reproving, and his piety in giving away much of whathe received from the bounty of the rich. He also addedthis to his vow above—mentioned; during Lent, he wouldeat but one meal &amp; day, allowing himself nothing butbread and thin milk, and even that by measure.

He made some stay in theparts beyond the sea, after his consecration, and Oswy,following the example‘of the king his son, sent a holyman, of modest behaviour, well read in the Scripture,and diligently practising those things which he hadlearned therein, to be ordained bishop of the church ofYork. This was a priest called Ceadda, brother to mmthe reverend prelate Cedd, of whom mention has been cud a'often made, and abbot of the monastery of Lestingau.With him the king also sent his priest Eadhed, who wasafterwards, in the reign of ngrid, made bishop of thechurch of Ripon.

Arriving at Rome, where Vitalian presided at UM“that time over the Apostolic See, and. having madeknown to the aforesaid pope the occasion of his journey,he was not long after snatched away, with almost all hiscompanions that went with him, by a pestilence whichhappened at that time.But the apostolic pope having consulted about thataffair, made diligent inquiry for some one to send to bearchbishop of the English churches. There was then inthe Niridan monastery, which is not far from the city ofNaples in Campania, an abbot, called Hadrian, by nationan African, well versed in holy writ, experienced inmonastica] and ecclesiastical discipline, and excellentlyskilled both in the Greek and Latin tongues. The pope,sending for him, commanded him to accept of thebishopric, and repair into Britain; he answered, that hewas unworthy of so great a dignity, but said he couldname another, whose learning and age were ﬁtter for theepiscopal ofﬁce. And having proposed to the pope acertain monk, belonging to a neighbouring monastery ofvirgins, whose name was Andrew, he was by all that knewhim judged worthy of a bishopric; but bodily inﬁrmityprevented his being advanced to the episcopal station.Then again Hadrian was pressed to accept of the bishopric; but he desired a respite for a time, to see whetherhe could ﬁnd another ﬁt to be ordained bishop.There was at that time in Rome, a monk, called Theo- 35mg?dore, well known to Hadrian, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, A.D. 668"a man well instructed in worldly and Divine literature,as also in Greek and Latin; of known probity of life,and venerable for age,being sixty—six years old. Hadrianoffered him to the pope to be ordained bishop, and prevailed; but upon these conditions, that he should conduct him into Britain, because he had already travelledthrough France twice upon several occasions, and was,therefore, better acquainted with the way, and was,moreover, suﬁiciently provided with men of his own; as</p>

He was ordained by Pope Vitalian, in the yearof our Lord 668, on Sunday, the 26th of March, and onthe 27th of May was sent with Hadrian into Britain.They proceeded by sea to Marseilles, and thence byland to Arles, and having there delivered to J ohn, archbishop of that city, Pope Vitalian’s letters of recommendation, were by him detained till Ebrin, the king’smayor'- of the palace, sent them a pass to go where theypleased. Having received the same, Theodore repairedto Agilbert, bishop of Paris, of whom we have spokenabove, and was by him kindly received, and long entertained. But Hadrian went ﬁrst to Emme, and then toFaro, bishops of Sens and Meaux, and lived with thema considerable time; for the hard winter had obligedthem to rest wherever they could. King Egbert, beinginfdrmed by messengers that the bishop they had askedof the Roman prelate was in the kingdom of France,sent thither his præfect, Redfrid, to conduct him;who, being arrived there, with Ebrin’s leave, conveyedhim to the port of Quentavic; where, being indisposed,he made some stay, and as soon as he began to recover,sailed over into Britain. But Ebrin detained Hadrian,suspecting that he went on some message from theemperor to the kings of Britain, to the prejudice of thekingdom, of which he at that time took especial care;however, when he found that he really had no such commiSsion, be discharged him, and permitted him to followTheodore.

He then livedretired at his monastery, which is at Lestingan, Wilfridﬁlling the bishopric of York, and of all the Northumbrians, and likewise of the Picts, as far as the dominionsof King Oswy extended. And, seeing that it was thecustom of that most reverend prelate to go about thework of the Gospel to several places rather on foot thanon horseback, Theodore commanded him to ride whenever he had a long journey to undertake, and ﬁnding himvery unwilling to omit his former pious labour, be himself, with his hands, lifted him on the horse; for hethought him a holy man, and therefore obliged him toride wherever he had need to go.

          <p>time from the labour and ministry of the word. When A.D. 669.he had most gloriously governed the church in that province two years and a half, the Divine Providence soordaining, there came round a. season like that of whichEcclesiastes says, “ That there is a time to cast stones,and a time to gather them ;” for there happened a mortality sent from heaven, which, by means of the deathof the ﬂesh, translated the stones of the church fromtheir earthly places to the heavenly building. Andwhen, after many of the church of that most reverendprelate had been taken out of the ﬂesh, his hour alsodrew near wherein he was to pass out of this worldto our Lord, it happened one day that he was in theaforesaid dwelling with only one brother, called Owini,his other companion being upon some reasonable occasion returned to the church. N ow Owini was a monk ofgreat merit, having forsaken the world with the pureintention of obtaining the heavenly reward; worthy inall respects to have the secrets of our Lord revealedto him, and worthy to have credit given by his hearersto what he said, for he came with Queen Etheldrid fromthe province of the East Angles, and was her primeminister, and governor of her family. As the fervourof his faith increased, resolving to renounce the world,he did not go about it slothfully, but so fully forsook thethings of this world, that, quitting all he had, clad in a.plain garment, and carrying an axe and hatchet in hishand, he came to the monastery of that most reverendprelate, called Lestingau; denoting, that he did not goto the monastery to live idle, as some do, but to labour,which he also conﬁrmed by practice; for as he was lesscapable of meditating on the Holy Scriptures, he themore earnestly applied himself to the labour of his hands.In short, he was received by the bishop into the houseaforesaid, and there entertained with the brethren, andwhilst they were engaged within in reading, he was without, doing such things as were necessary.C</p>

Qui cum aliquantulum horæquasi attonitus maneret, et [quid hoc esset solerti animoscrutaretur, aperuit episcopus fenestram oratorii, etsonitum manu faciens, ut sæpe consueverat, si quis forisesset, ad se intrare præcepit. Introivit ille concitus,cui dixit antistes, “ Vade cito ad ecclesiam, et hos sepltem fratres huc venire facito; tu quoque simul adesto."Qui cum venissent, primo admonuit eos, ut virtutemdilectionis et pacis ad invicem et ad omnes ﬁdeles servarent; instituta quoque disciplinæ regularis, quæ vel abipso didicissent et in ipso vidissent, vel in patrum præcedentium factis sive dictis invenissent, indefessa instantiasequerentur.

          <p>One day When he was thus employed abroad, and his A.D. 669.companions were gone to the church, as I began tostate, the bishop was alone reading or praying in theoratory of that place, when on a sudden, as he afterwardssaid, he heard the voice of persons singing most sweetlyand rejoicing, and appearing to descend from heaven.Which voice he said he ﬁrst heard coming from thesouth—east, and that afterwards it drew near him, till itcame to the roof of the oratory where the bishop was,and entering therein, ﬁlled the same and all about it.He listened attentively to what he heard, and after abouthalf an hour, perceived the same song of joy to ascendfrom the roof of the said oratory, and to return toheaven the same way it came, with inexpressible sweet—ness. When he had stood some time astonished, andseriously revolving in his mind what it might be, thebishop opened the window of the oratory, and making anoise with his hand, as he was often wont to do, orderedhim to come in to him. He accordingly went hastily in,and the bishop said to him, “ Make haste to the church,and cause the seven brothers to come hither, and do youcome with them.” When they were come, he ﬁrstadmonished them to preserve the virtue of peace amongthemselves, and towards all others ; and indefatigably topractise the rules of regular discipline, which they hadeither been taught by him, or seen him observe, or hadnoticed in the words or actions of the former fathers.Then he added, that the day of his death was at hand;for, said he, “ that amiable guest, who was wont to visitour brethren, has vouchsafed also to come to me thisday, and to call me out of this world. Return, therefore, to the church, and speak to the brethren, that theyin their prayers recommend my passage to our Lord, andthat they be careful to provide for their own, the hourwhereof is uncertain, by watching, prayer, and goodworks.”When he had spoken thus much and more, and they,c 2</p>
          <p>illi, percepta ejus benedictione, jam multum tristes exiissent, rediit ipse solus, qui carmen coeleste audierat, etprosternens se in terram, “ Obsecro," inquit, “pater,licet aliquid interrogare ?"-—“ Interroga," inquit, “ quodvis.” At ille, “Obsecro,” inquit;, “ut dicas, quod erat.canticum illud lætantium, quod audivi, venientium decælis super oratorium hoc, et post tempus redeuntiumad coelos?" Respondit ille, “ Si vocem caminis audiisti,et coelestes supervenire coetus cognovisti, praecipio tibiin nomine Domini, ne hoc cuiquam ante meum obitumdicas. Revera autem angelorum fuere spiritus, qui mead coelestia, quae semper amabam ac desiderabam, præmia vocare venerunt, et post dies septem se redituros,ac me secum adducturos esse, promiserunt." Quodquidem ita, ut dictum ei erat, opere completum est.Nam confestim languore corporis tactus est, et hoc perdies ingravescente, septimo,'ut promissum ei fuerat, die,postquam obitum suum Dominici corporis et sanguinisperceptione munivit, soluta ab ergastulo corporis animasancta, ducentibus, ut credi fas est, angelis comitibus,æterna gaudia petivit.Non autem mirum si diem mortis, vel potius diemDomini, lætus aspexit, quem semper, usquedum veniret,solicitus exspectare curavit.

Si autem violentior aura</p>
          <p>having received his blessing, had gone away in sorrow, A.D.669.he, who had heard the heavenly song, returned alone,and prostrating himself on the ground, said, “ I beseechyou, father, may I be permitted to ask a. question ?”—“ Ask what you will,” answered the bishop. Then headded, “ I entreat you to tell me what song of joy wasthat which I heard coming upon this oratory, and aftersome time returning to heaven ?" The bishop answered,“ If you heard the singing, and know the coming of theheavenly company, I command you, in the name of ourLord, that you do not tell the same to any before mydeath. They were angelic spirits, who came to call meto my heavenly reward, which I have always longedafter, and they promised they would return seven dayshence, and take me away with them.” Which wasaccordingly fulﬁlled, as had been said to him; for beingpresently seized with a languishing distemper, and thesame daily increasing, on the seventh day, as had beenpromised to him, When he had prepared for death byreceiving the body and blood of our Lord, his soul beingdelivered from the prison of the body, the angels, asmay justly be believed, attending him, he departed tothe joys of heaven. ,It is no wonder that he joyfully beheld the day of hisdeath, or rather the day of our Lord, which he hadalways carefully expected till it came; for notwithstanding his many merits of continence, humility, teaching, prayer, voluntary poverty, and other virtues, hewas so full of the fear of God, so mindful of his lastend in all his actions, that, as I was informed by one ofthe brothers who instructed me in divinity, and Who hadbeen bred in his monastery, and under his direction,whose name was Trumhere, if it happened that thereblew a. strong gust of wind when he was reading ordoing any other thing, he immediately called upon Godfor mercy, and begged it might be extended to all mankind. If the wind grew stronger, he closed his book,</p>

But, if it proved a violent storm of ' wind orrain, or else that the earth and air were ﬁlled withthunder and lightning, he would repair to the church,and devote himself to prayers and repeating of psalmstill the weather became calm. Being asked by his followers why he‘ did so, he answered, “ Have not youread—‘ The Lord also thundered in the heavens, andthe Highest gave forth, his voice. Yea, he sent out hisarrows and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings,and discomﬁted them.’ For the Lord moves the air,raises the winds, darts lightning, and thunders fromheaven, to excite the inhabitants of the earth to fearhim; to put them in mind of the future judgment; todispel their pride, and vanquish their boldness, bybringing into their thoughts that dreadful time, whenthe heavens and the earth being in a ﬂame, he will comein the clouds, with great power and majesty, to judgethe quick and the dead. Wherefore,” said he, “ itbehoves us to answer his heavenly admonition with duefear and love ; that, as often as he lifts his hand throughthe trembling sky, as it were to strike, but does not yetlet it fall, we may immediately implore his mercy; andsearching the recesses of our hearts, and cleansing theﬁlth of our vices, we may carefully behave ourselves soas never to be struck.”With this revelation and account of the aforesaidbrother, concerning the death of this prelate, agrees thediscourse of the most reverend Father Egbert, abovespoken of, who long led a monastic life with the sameCeadda, when both were youths, in Ireland, praying,observing continency, and meditating on the Holy Scriptures.

In bothwhich places, as a testimony of his virtue, frequentmiraculous cures are wont to be wrought. And of late,a. certain distracted person, who had been wanderingabout everywhere, arrived there in the evening, unknownor unregarded by the keepers of the place, and havingrested there all the night, went out in his perfect sensesthe next morning, to the surprise and delight of all;thus showing that a. cure had been performed on himthrough the goodness of God. The place of the sepulchre is a wooden monument, made like a. little house,covered, having a hole in the wall, through which thosethat go thither for devotion usually put in their handand take out some of the dust, which they put intowater and give to sick cattle or men to drink, uponwhich they are presently eased of their inﬁrmity, andrestored to health. In his place, Theodore ordainedWinfrid, a. good and modest man, to preside, as hispredecessors had done, over the bishoprics of the Mercians, the Midland Angles, and the Lindisfarnes, of allwhich, Wulfhere, who was still living, was king.

This Earconwald’s life and conversation, as well when he was bishop as before his advancement to that dignity, is reported to have been mostholy, as is even at this time testiﬁed by heavenly mira- Miracles ofcles; for to this day, his horse—litter, in which he was ?:?:lmwald.wont to be carried when sick, is kept by his disciples,'and continues to cure many of agues and other distempers; and not. only sick persons who are laid in thatlitter, or close by it, are cured ; but the very chips of it,when carried to the sick, are wont immediately to restorethem to health. .This 'man, before he was made bishop, had built twofamous monasteries, the one for himself, and the otherfor his sister Ethelberga, and established them both inregular discipline of the best kind.

When the mortality, which we have alreadyso often mentioned, ravaging all around, had also seizedon that part of this monastery where the men resided,and they were daily hurried away to meet their God, thecareful mother of the society began often to inquire inthe convent, of the sisters, where they would have theirbodies buried, and where a church-yard should be made,when the same pestilence should fell upon that partof the monastery in which God’s female servants weredivided from the men, and they'should be snatched awayout of this world by the same destruction.

This light was sogreat, that one of the eldest of the brothers, who atthe same time was in their oratory with another youngerthan himself, related in the morning, that the raysof light which came in at the crannies of the doorsand windows, seemed to exceed the utmost brightness ofdaylight itself.CHAP.

          <p>perfected in afﬂiction, according to the apostle, she was A.D. 676.suddenly seized with a most grievous distemper, underwhich, through the good providence of our Redeemer,she suffered very much for the space of nine years; tothe end, that whatever stain of vice remained amidst hervirtues, either through ignorance or neglect, might allbe eradicated by the ﬁre of long tribulation. This person,going out of her chamber one night, just at the ﬁrstdawn of the day, plainly saw as it were a human body,which was brighter than the sun, wrapped up in a sheet,and lifted up on high, being taken out of the house inwhich the sisters used to reside. Then looking earnestlyto see what 'it was that drew up the glorious body whichshe beheld, she perceived' it was" drawn up as it were bycords brighter than ”gold, until, entering into the openheavens, it could no longer be seen by her. Reﬂectingon this vision, she made no doubt that someone of thesociety would soon die", and her soul be lifted up toheaven by her good works, as it were by golden cords,which’accordingly happened; for a few days after, thebeloved of God, Ethelberga, mother of that society, wasdelivered out of the prison of the ﬂesh;' and her life isknown to have been such’that no person who knew herought to question but that the heavenly kingdom wasopen to her, when she departed from this world.There was also, in the same monastery, a certain nun,of noble worldly origin, and much nobler in the love ofthe world to come; who had, for many years, been sodisabled in all her body, that she could not move asingle limb. Being informed that the venerable abbess’sbody was carried into the church, till it could be buried,she desired to be carried thither, and to be bowed downtowards it, after the manner of one praying ; whichbeing done, she spoke to her as if she had been living,and entreated her that she would obtain of the mercy ofour compassionate Creator, that she might be deliveredfrom such great and lasting pains; nor was it long before</p>

Having so said, shewas silent awhile, as it were waiting for the answer ofthe person she saw and spoke to; then, as if displeased,she said, “ I am not pleased with this ;” then pausingawhile, she said again, “ If it cannot be to-day, I begthe delay may not be long;” and again holding herpeace a. short while, she concluded thus: “ If it is positively so decreed, and the resolution cannot be altered, Ibeg that it may be no longer deferred than this nextnight.” Having so said, and being asked by those abouther to whom she talked, she said, “ With my most dearmother, Ethelbergaf’. by which they understood, thatshe was come to acquaint her that the time ‘of herdeparture was at hand; for, as she had desired, afterone day and night, she was delivered from the bonds andinﬁrmity of the ﬂesh, and entered the joys of eternalsalvation.</p>

He was much addicted to_ religious actions, almsgivings, and"»m-.« .. , , -' frequent prayer; preferring a priwealth and honours of his kingdom, which sort of lifehe would also long before have undertaken, had not hiswife positively refused to be divorced from him; forwhich reason many were of opinion, and often said so,that a person of such a. disposition ought rather to havebeen a bishop than a. king. When he had been thirtyyears a king, and a soldier of the heavenly kingdom, hefell into a. violent sickness, of which he died, and admonished his wife, that they should then at least jointlydevote themselves to the service of God, since theycould no longer enjoy, or rather serve, the world.Having with much difﬁculty obtained this of her, herepaired to Waldhere, bishop of London, who had succeeded Earconwald, and With his blessing received thereligious habit, Which he had long desired.

The bishophaving promised that he would most willingly performthe same, not long after the man of God composedhimself to sleep, and saw a comforting vision, whichtook from him all anxiety for the aforesaid uneasiness;and, moreover, showed him on what day he was todepart this life. For, as he afterwards related, he sawthree men in bright garments come to him; one ofwhom sat down before his bed, whilst his companionsstood and inquired about the state of the sick man theycame to see: he who was sitting in front of the bedsaid, that his soul should depart his body without anypain, and with a great splendour of light ; and declaredthat he should die the third day after; both which particulars happened, as he had been informed by the vision;for on the third day after, he suddenly fell, as it were,into a slumber, and breathed out his soul without anysense or pain.A stone coﬁin having been provided for burying hisbody, when they came to lay it in the same, they foundhis body a span longer than the cofﬁn. Hereupon theyhewed away the stone, and made the coﬂin about twoﬁngers longer; but neither would it then contain thebody. Under this difﬁculty of entombing him, they had</p>

Theodoreconsecrated Cnichehn bishop of Rochester in his stead;but he, not long after, departing from his bishopric forwant of necessaries, and withdrawing to other parts,Gebmnnd was substituted in his place.In the year of our Lord's incarnation 678, which isthe eighth of the reign of ngrid, in the month of August, appeared a star, called a comet, which continuedfor three months, rising in the morning, and darting out,as it were, a pillar of radiant ﬂame. The same year a.dissension broke out between King ngrid and the mostreverend prelate, Wilfrid, who was driven from his see,and two bishops substituted in his stead, to preside overthe nation of the Northumbrians, namely, Bosa, to preside over the nation of the Deiri ; and Eata over that ofthe Bernicians; the latter having his see in the city ofYork, the former in the church of Hagulstad, or elseLindisfarne; both of them promoted to the episcopaldignity from a society of monks.

          <p>of Wight, and the province of Meanwara, in the nation A.D.681.of the West Saxons. The bishop, therefore, with theking’s consent, or rather to his great satisfaction, baptized the principal generals and soldiers of that country;and the priests, Eappa, and Padda, and Burghelm, andEadda, either then,or afterwards, baptized the rest of thepeople. The queen, whose name was Ebba, had beenchristened in her own island, the province of the Wiccii.She was the daughter of Eanfrid, the brother of Eanher,who were both Christians, as were their people; but allthe province of the South Saxons were strangers to thename and faith of God. There was among them a certain monk of the Scottish nation, whose name was Dicul,who had a very small monastery, at the place calledBosanham, encompassed with the sea and woods, and init ﬁve or six brothers, who served our Lord in povertyand humility; but none of the natives cared either tofollow their course of life, or hear their preaching.But Bishop Wilfrid, by preaching to them, not onlydelivered them from the misery of perpetual damnation,but also from an inexpressible calamity of temporaldeath, for no rain had fallen in that province in threeyears before his arrival, whereupon a dreadful famineensued, which cruelly destroyed thepeople. In short, itis reported, that very often, forty or ﬁfty men being spentwith want, would go together to some precipice, orto the seashore, and there, hand in hand, perish by thefall, or be swallowed up by the waves. But on the veryday on which the nation received the baptism of faith,there fell a soft but plentiful rain; the earth revivedagain, and the verdure being restored to the ﬁelds, theseason was pleasant and fruitful. Thus the formersuperstition being rejected, and idolatry exploded, thehearts and ﬂesh of all rejoiced in the living God, andbecame convinced that He who is the true God had,through his heavenly grace, enriched them with wealth,both temporal and spiritual. For the bishop, when he</p>

          <p>came into the province, and found so great misery from A.D. 681.famine, taught them to get their food by ﬁshing; fortheir sea and rivers abounded in ﬁsh, but the people hadno skill to take them, except eels alone. The bishop’smen having gathered eel-nets every where, cast theminto the sea, and by the blessing of God took three hundred ﬁshes of several sorts, which, being divided intothree parts, they gave a hundred to the poor, a hundredto those of whom they had the nets, and kept a hundredfor their own use. By this beneﬁt the bishop gainedthe affections of them all, and they began more readilyat his preaching to hope for heavenly goods, seeing thatby his help they had received those which are temporal.At this time, King Ethelwalch gave to the mostreverend prelate, Wilfrid, land of eighty—seven families,to maintain his company who were in banishment, whichplace is called Seleseu, that is, the Island of the Sea.Calf. That place is encompassed by the sea. on all sides,except the west, where is an entrance about the cast ofa. sling in width; which sort of place is by the Latinscalled a peninsula, by the Greeks, a. chersonesus. BishopWilfrid, having this place given him, founded therein a.monastery, which his successors possess to this day, andestablished a regular course of life, chieﬂy of the brethrenhe had brought with him; for he both in word andactions performed the duties of a bishop in those partsduring the space of ﬁve years, until the death of Kingngrid. And forasmuch as the aforesaid king, togetherwith the said place, gave him all the goods that weretherein, with the lands and men, he instructed themin the faith of Christ, and baptized them all. Amongwhom were two hundred and ﬁfty men and womenslaves, all of whom he, by baptism, not only rescuedfrom the servitude of the Devil, but gave them theirbodily liberty also, and exempted them from the yoke ofhuman servitude.</p>

Of which number I have' thought it proper to perpetuate thememory of one, which the most reverend Bishop Accawas wont to relate to me, aﬁirming it had been told himV by most creditable brothers of the same monastery.About the same time that this province of the SouthSaxons embraced the faith of Christ, a grievous mortality ran through many provinces of Britain; which, also,by the Divine dispensation, reached to the aforesaid monastery, then governed by the most reverend and religious priest of Christ, Eappa; and many, aswell of thosethat came thither with the bishop, as of those that hadbeen called to the faith of the same province of theSouth Saxons, were snatched away out of this world.The brethren, in consequence, thought ﬁt to keep a fastof three days, and to implore the Divine goodness, thatit would vouchsafe to extend mercy to them, either bydelivering those that were in danger by the distemperfrom death, or by delivering those who departed this lifefrom eternal damnation.There was at that time in the monastery, a little boy,_ of the Saxon nation, lately called.to the faith, who hadbeen seized with the same distemper, and had long kepthis bed. On the second day of the fasting and praying,it happened that the said boy was, about the second hourof the day, left alone in the place where he lay sick, andthrough the Divine disposition, the most blessed princesF</p>

          <p>of the apostles vouchsafed to appear to him; for he was A.D.681.a. lad of an extraordinarily mild and innocent disposition,and with sincere devotion observed the mysteries of thefaith which he had received. The apostles thereforesaluting him in a most affectionate manner, said, “ Mychild, do not fear death, about which you are so uneasy;for we will this day conduct you to the heavenly kingdom; but you are ﬁrst to stay till the masses are said,that having received the body and blood of our Lord, tosupport you on your journey, and being so dischargedthrough sickness and death, you may be carried up tothe everlasting joys in heaven. '“ Call therefore to you the priest, Eappa, and tell him,that the Lord has heard your prayers and devotion, andhas favourably accepted of your fast, and not one moreshall die of this plague, either in the monastery or itsadjacent possessions; but all your people who any wherelabour under this distemper, shall be eased of their pain,and restored to their former health, except you alone,who are this day to be delivered by death, and to becarried into heaven, to behold our Lord Christ, whomyou have faithfully served: this favour the Divine mercyhas vouchsafed to grant you, through the intercession ofthe godly and dear servant of God, King Oswald, whoformerly ruled over the nation of the Northumbrians,with the authority of a temporal king, and such devotionof Christian piety as leads to the heavenly kingdom; forthis very day that king was killed in war by the inﬁdels,and taken up to the everlasting joys of souls in heaven,and associated among the number of the elect. Letthem look in their books, wherein the departure of thedead is set down, and they will ﬁnd that he was, this day,as we have said, taken out of this world. Let them,therefore, celebrate masses in all the oratories of thismonastery, either in thanksgiving for their prayers beingheard, or else in memory of the aforesaid King Oswald,who once governed their nation; and therefore heF 2</p>
          <p>eis, quasi pro suæ gentis advenis, supplex orabat ad Dominum; et, cunctis convenientibus ad ecclesiam fratribus,communicent omnes sacriﬁciis cælestibus, et, ita. solutojejunio, corpus quoque suis reficiant alimentis."Quæ cum omnia, vocato ad se præbytero, puer verbanarrasset, interrogavit eum solicitus quales essent habituvel specie viri, qui sibi apparuissent. Respondit, “ Præclari omnino habitu et vultu erant, lætissimi ac pulcherrimi, quales nunquam ante videram, neque aliquos ho—minum tanti decoris ac venustatis esse posse credebam.Unus quidem attonsus erat, ut clericus, alius barbamhabebat prolixam; dicebantque, quod unus eorum Petrus, alius vocaretur Paulus, et ipsi essent ministri Domini et Salvatoris nostri Jesu Christi, ad tuitionemnostri monasterii missi ab ipso de cælis." Credidit ergoverbis pueri presbyter, ac statim egressus requisivit inAnnali suo, et invenit eadem ipsa die Oswaldum regemfuisse peremtum; vocatisque fratribus, parari prandium,missas ﬁeri, atque omnes communicare more solito præcepit, simul et infirmanti puero de eodem sacrificio Dominicæ oblationis particulam deferri mandavit.Quibus ita. gestis, non multo post, eadem ipsa diepuer defunctus est, suaque morte probavit vera fuisseverba, quæ ab apostolis Christi audierat. Sed et hocejus verbis testimonium perhibuit, quod nemo præteripsum tempore illo ex eodem est monasterio raptus demundo; ex qua nimirum visione multi, qui hæc audirepotuerunt, et ad exorandam in adversis divinam clementiam et ad salutaria jejuniorum remedia subeunda suntmirabiliter accensi; et ex eo tempore non solum in eodemmonasteriofsed et in plerisque locis aliis, cæpit annuatim ejusdem regis ac militis Christi natalitius dies missarum celebratione venerari.</p>
          <p>humbly offered up his prayers to our Lord for them, as A.D.681.for strangers of his nation; and let all the brethren,assembling in the church, communicate in the heavenlysacriﬁces, and so let them cease to fast, and refreshthemselves with food.”The boy called the priest, and repeated all these wordsto him; the priest particularly inquired after the habitand form of the men that had appeared to him. He answered, “ Their habit was noble, and their countenancesmost pleasant and beautiful, such as I had never seenbefore, nor did I think there could be any men so graceful and comely. One of them indeed was shom like a.clerk, the other had a long beard; and they said thatone of them was called Peter, the other Paul; and both.of them the servants of our Lord and Saviour J esusChrist, sent by him from heaven to protect our monastery.” The priest believed what the boy said, and goingthence immediately, looked in his chronicle, and foundthat King Oswald had been killed on that very day. Hethen called the brethren, ordered dinner to be provided,masses to be said, and all of them to communicate asusual; causing also part of the Lord’s oblation of thesame sacriﬁce to be carried to the sick boy.Soon after this, the boy died, on that same day; andby his death proved that what he had heard from theapostles of God was true. A further testimony of thetruth of his words was, that no person besides himself,belonging to the same monastery, died at that time. Bywhich vision, many that heard of it were wonderfullyexcited to implore the Divine mercy in adversity, andto adopt the Wholesome remedy of fasting. From thattime, the day of the nativity of that king and soldier ofChrist began to be yearly honoured with the celebrationof masses, not only in that monastery, but in many otherplaces.</p>

The measure of that island,according to the computation of the English, is of twelvehundred familia, and accordingly the bishop had givenhim land of three hundred families. The part which hereceived, he committed to one of his clerks called Bern—win, who was his sister’s son, assigning him a priest,whose name was Hiddila, who might administer theword and baptism of salvation to all that would besaved.Here I think it ought not to be omitted that, as theﬁrst fruits of the natives of that island that by believingwere saved, two royal youths, brothers to Atwald, kingof the island, were honoured by the particular grace ofGod. For the enemy approaching, they made theirescape out of the island, and passed over into the neighbouring province of the J utes. Where being conductedto the place called, At the Stone, as they thought to beconcealed from the victorious king, they were betrayedand ordered to be killed. This being made known to acertain abbot and priest, whose name was Cynebert, whohad a monastery not far from thence, at a place calledReodford, that is, the Ford of Reeds, he came to theking, who then lay privately in those parts, to be curedof the wounds which he had received whilst he was ﬁghting in the Isle of Wight, and begged of him, that if thelads must inevitably be killed, he might be allowed ﬁrstto instruct them in the mysteries of the faith. The kingconsented, and the bishop having taught them the wordof truth, and cleansed their souls by baptism, made theentrance into the kingdom of heaven sure to them.

The AbbotJ ohn did as he had been commanded by the pope,teaching the singers of the said monastery the orderand manner of singing and reading aloud, and committing to writing all that was requisite throughout thewhole course of the year for the celebration of festivals;all which are still observed in that monastery, and havebeen copied by many others elsewhere.

Then having rested awhile, hestood up, and began to go oﬁ' to seek some friends thatmight take care of him; but in so doing he was discoveredand taken by some of the enemy’s army, and carriedbefore their lord, who was an earl belonging to KingEthelred. Being asked by him who he was, and fearing,to own himself a soldier, he answered, “ He was a peasant, poor and married, and that he came to the armywith others to bring provisions to the soldiers.” Theearl entertained him, and ordered his wounds to bedressed; and when he began to recover, to prevent hisescaping, he ordered him to be bound ; but that could notbe performed, for as soon as they that bound him weregone, his bonds were all loosened.He had a brother called Tunna, who was a priest andabbot of a. monastery in the city, which from him is stillcalled Tunnaeester.

The earl then _privately sending for him, pressed to know who he was,promising to do him no harm, if he would ingeuuouslyconfess his quality. Which when he had done, declaringthat he had been the king's servant, the earl answered,“ I perceived by your answers that you were no peasant.And now you deserve to die, because all my brothersand relations were killed in that ﬁght; yet I will notput you to death, because it will be a breach of mypromise.”As soon, therefore, as he was recovered, he sold himat London, to a Freson, but he could not be bound byhim the whole way as he was led along; but though hisenemies put several sorts of bonds on him, they were allloosed. The buyer, perceiving that he could in no waybe bound, gave him leave to ransom himself if he could;now it was at the third hour (nine in the morning) whenthe masses were wont to be said, that his bonds were,generally loosed. He, having taken an oath that hewould either return, or send him the money for his ransom, went into Kent to King Lothaire, who was son tothe sister of Queen Etheldrida, above spoken of, for hehad once been her servant. From him he obtained theprice of his ransom, and as he had promised, sent it tohis master.Returning afterwards into his own country, andcoming to his brother, he gave him an exact account ofall his fortunes, good and bad; and by his relation heunderstood, that his bonds had been generally loosed atthose times when masses had been celebrated for him;and that other advantages which had accrued to him inhis time of danger, had been conferred on him fromHeaven, through the intercession of his brother, and theoblation of his saving sacriﬁce.

Being led by her example, she continued awhole year in the aforesaid province, with the design ofgoing abroad; afterwards, Bishop Aidan being recalledhome, he gave her the land of one family on the northside of the river Wire; where for a year she also led amonastic life, with very few companions.After this she was made abbess in the monasterycalled Heruteu, which monastery had been founded, notlong before, by the religious servant of Christ, Heru,who is said to have been the ﬁrst woman that in theprovince of the Northumbrians took upon her the habitand life of a. nun, being consecrated by Bishop Aidan;but she, soon after she had founded that monastery,went away to the city of Kalcacestir, and there ﬁxed herdwelling. Hilda, the servant of Christ, being set overthat monastery, began immediately to reduce all thingsto a regular system, according.a.s she had been instructedby learned men; for Bishop Aidan, and other religiousmen that knew her and loved her, frequently visited anddiligently instructed her, because of her innate wisdomand inclination to the service of God.When she had for some years governed this monastery, Wholly intent upon establishing a regular life, ithappened that she also undertook either to build or toarrange a nionastery in the place called Streaneshalch,which work she industriously performed; for she putthis monastery under the same regular discipline as shehad done the former; and taught there the strict observance of justice, piety, chastity, and other virtues, andparticularly of peace and charity; so that, after the exaample of the primitive church, no person was there rich,and none poor, all being in common to all, and none</p>

Her prudence was so great, that A.D. 680.not only indifferent persons, but even kings and princes,as occasion offered, asked and received her advice; sheobliged those who were under her direction to attend somuch to reading of the Holy Scriptures, and to exercisethemselves so much in works of justice, that many mightbe there found ﬁt for ecclesiastical duties, and to serveat the altar.In short, we afterwards saw ﬁve bishops taken out ofthat monastery, and all of them men of singular meritand sanctity, whose names were Bosa, Eda, Oftfor, J ohn,and Wilfrid. We have above taken notice, that theﬁrst of them was consecrated bishop at York; of thesecond, it is to be observed that he was appointed bishopof Dorchester. Of the two last we shall speak hereafter,as they were consecrated: the ﬁrst was bishop of Hagulstad, the second of the church of York; of the thirdwe will here take notice, that having applied himself tothe reading and observation of the scriptures, in boththe monasteries of Hilda, at length being desirous toattain to greater perfection, he went into Kent, toArchbishop Theodore, 6f blessed memory; where havingspent some more time in sacred studies, he also resolvedto go to Rome, which, in those days, was reckoned ofgreat moment: returning thence into Britain, he took hisway into the province of the Wiccii, where King Osricthen ruled, and continued there a long time, preachingthe word of faith, and making himself an example ofgood life to all that saw and heard him. At that time,Bosel, the bishop of that province, laboured under suchweakness of body, that he could not himself perform theepiscopal functions; for which reason, this Oftfor was,by universal consent, chosen bishop in his stead, and byorder of King Ethelred, consecrated by Bishop Wilfrid,of blessed memory, who was then bishop of the MidlandAngles, because Archbishop Theodore was dead, and noother bishop ordained in his place.

          <p>man of God, Bose], Tatfrid, a most learned and indus- A.D.680.trious man, and of excellent ability, had been chosenbishop there, from the same abbess’s monastery, but hadbeen snatched away by an untimely death, before hecould be ordained.Thus this servant of Christa Abbess Hilda, whom allthat knew her called Mother, for her singular piety andgrace, was not only an example of good life to thosethat lived in her monastery, but afforded occasion ofamendment and salvation to many who lived at a distance, to whom the fame was brought of her industryand virtue; for it was necessary that the dream whichher mother, Bregusuit, had, during her infancy, shouldbe fulﬁlled. At the time that her husband, Heretic,lived in banishment, under Cerdic, king of the Britons,where he was also poisoned, she fancied, in a dream,that she was seeking for him, most carefully, and couldﬁnd no sign of him any where; but, after having usedall her industry to seek him, she found a most preciousjewel under her garment, which, whilst she was lookingon it very attentively, cast such a light as spread itselfthroughout all Britain; which dream was brought topass in her daughter that we speak of, whose life was abright example, not only to herself, but to all who desired to live well.When she had governed this monastery many years,it pleased Him who has made such merciful provisionfor our salvation, to give her holy soul the trial of along sickness, to the end that, according to the apostle’sexample, her virtue might be perfected in inﬁrmity.Falling into a fever, she fell into a violent heat, and wasafﬂicted with the same for six years continually; duringall which time she never failed either to return thanksto her Maker, or publicly and.privately to instruct theﬂock committed to her charge; for by her own exampleshe admonished all persons to serve God dutifully inperfect health, and always to return thanks to him in</p>

In the seventh year of A.D.680.her sickness, the distemper turning inwards, she approached her last day, and about cockcrowing, havingreceived the holy communion to further her on her way,and called together the servants of Christ that werewithin the same monastery, she admonished them topreserve evangelical peace among themselves, and withall others; and as she was making her speech, shejoyfully saw death approaching, or if I may speak in thewords of our Lord, passed from death to life.That same night it pleased Almighty God, by amanifest vision, to make known her death in anothermonastery, at a distance from hers, which she had builtthat same year, and is called Hakenes. There was inthat monastery a certain nun called Begu, who, havingdedicated her virginity to God, had served him upwardsof thirty years in monastica] conversation. This nunbeing then in the dormitory of the sisters, on a suddenheard the well-known sound of a bell in the air, whichused to awake and call them to prayers, when any oneof them was taken out of this world, and opening hereyes, as she thought, she saw the top of the house open,and a strong light pour in from above; looking earnestlyupon that light, she saw the soul of the aforesaid servant.of God in that same light, attended and conducted toheaven by angels. Then awaking, and seeing the other‘sisters lying round about her, she perceived that whatshe had seen was either in a. dream or a vision; andrising immediately in a great fright, she ran to thevirgin who then presided in the monastery instead ofthe abbess, and whose name was Frigyth, and withmany tears and sighs, told her that the Abbess Hilda,mother of them all, had departed this life, and had inher sight ascended to eternal bliss, and to the companyof the inhabitants of heaven, with a great light, andwith angels conducting her. Frigyth having heard it,awoke all the sisters, and calling them to the church,</p>

          <p>cause I could not sing.” The other who talked to him, MM",replied, “ However you shall sing.”——“ What shall Ising?” rejoined he. “Sing the beginning of createdbeings,” said the other. Hereupon he presently beganto sing verses to the praise of God, which he had neverheard, the purport whereof was thus :—We are now topraise the Maker of the heavenly kingdom, the power ofthe Creator and his counsel, the deeds of the Father ofglory. How "he, being the eterna.] God, became theauthor of all miracles, who ﬁrst, as almighty preserver"of the human race, created heaven for the sons of menas‘the roof of the house, and next the earth. This isthe sense, but not the words in order as he sang themin his sleep ; for verses, though never so well composed,cannot be literally translated out of one language intoanother, without losing much of their beauty and loftiness. Awaking from his sleep, he remembered all thathe had sung in his dream, and soon added much moreto the same effect in verse worthy of the Deity.In the morning he came to the steward, his superior,and having acquainted him with the gift he had received,was conducted t0 the abbess, by whom he was ordered,in the presence of many learned men, to tell his dream,and repeat the verses, that they might all give theirjudgment what it was, and whence his verse proceeded.They all concluded, that heavenly grace had been conferred on him by our Lord. They expounded to him apassage in holy writ, either historical, or doctrinal,ordering him, if he could, to put the same into verse.Having undertaken it, he went away, and returning thenext morning, gave it to them composed in most excellent verse ; whereupon the abbess, embracing the graceof God in the man, instructed him to quit the secularhabit, and take upon him the monastic life ; which beingaccordingly done, she associated him to the rest of thebrethren in her monastery, and ordered that he shouldbe taught the whole series of sacred history.

He sang the creationof the world, the origin of man, and all the history ofGenesis; and made many verses on the departure ofthe children of Israel out of Egypt, and their enteringinto the land of promise, with many other histories fromholy writ; the incarnation, passion, resurrection of ourLord, and his ascension into heaven; the coming of theHoly Ghost, and the preaching of the apostles; also theterror of future judgment, the horror of the pains ofhell, and the delights of heaven; besides many moreabout the Divine beneﬁts and judgments, by which heendeavoured to turn away all men from the love of vice,and to excite in them the love of, and application to,good actions; 'for he was a very religious man, andhumbly submissive to regular discipline, but full of zealagainst those who behaved themselves otherwise; forwhich reason he ended his life happily.For when the time of his departure drew near, helaboured for the space of fourteen days under a bodilyinﬁrmity which seemed to prepare the way, yet so moderate that he could talk and walk the whole time. Inhis neighbourhood was the house to which those thatwere sick, and like shortly to die, were carried. Hedesired the person that attended him, in the evening, asthe night came on in which he was to depart this life, tomake ready a place there for him to take his rest. Thisperson, wondering why he should desire it, because therewas as yet no sign of his dying soon, did what he hadordered. He accordingly went there, and conversingpleasantly in a joyful manner with the rest that were inthe house before, when it was past midnight, he askedthem, whether they had the Eucharist there? Theyanswered, “ What need of the Eucharist? for you arenot likely to die, since you talk so merrily with us, as if</p>

Theyanswered, that they were all in perfect charity, and freefrom anger; and in their turn asked him, whether hewas in the same mind towards them? He answered,“ I am in charity, my children, with all the servants ofGod.” Then strengthening himself with the heavenlyviaticum, he prepared for the entrance into another life,and asked, how near the time was when the brotherswere to be awakened to sing the nocturnal praises of ourLord? They answered, “ It is not far oﬁ'.” Then hesaid, “ Well, let us wait that hour ;" and signing him—self with the sign of the cross, he laid his head on thepillow, and falling into a slumber, ended his life so insilence. .Thus it came to pass, that as he had served Godwith a simple and pure mind, and undisturbed devotion,so he now departed to his presence, leaving the world bya quiet death; and that tongue, which had composed somany holy words in praise of the Creator, uttered itslast words whilst he was in the act of signing himselfwith the cross, and recommending himself into hishands, and by what has been here said, he seems to havehad foreknowledge of his death.</p>

Butthere wanted not a warning of the approaching punishment from the Divine goodness, by which they might havestood corrected, 'and by fasting, prayers, and tears, likethe Ninevites, have averted the anger of the just J udge.There was in that monastery a man of the Scottishrace, called Adamnan, leading a life entirely devoted toGod in continence and prayer, insomuch that he nevertook any food or drink, except only on Sundays andThursdays; but often spent whole nights in prayer.This austerity of life he had ﬁrst adopted from necessityto correct his evil propensities; but in process of timethe necessity became a custom.For in his youth he had been guilty of some wickedaction, for which, when he came to himself, he conceivedextraordinary horror, and dreaded lest he should be punished for the same by the upright J udge. Repairing,therefore, to a priest, who he hoped might show him theway of salvation, he confessed his guilt, and desired to beadvised how he might avoid the future wrath of God.The priest having heard his offence, said, “ A great sorerequires much attention in the cure; and, therefore, giveyourself up as far as you are able to fasting, reading ofpsalms, and prayer, to the end, that thus preventing thewrath of our Lord, in confession, you may ﬁnd him mer56 u m com".

Being highly affected with the grief of a guilty A.D.679.conscience, and desiring, as soon as possible, to be loosedfrom the inward fetters of sin, which lay heavy upon him,he answered, “ I am young in years, and strong of body,and shall, therefore easily bear with whatsoever you shallenjoin me to do, so that I may be saved in the day of .our Lord; though you should command me to spend thewhole night in prayer standing, and to pass the wholeweek in abstinence.” The priest replied, “ It is toomuch for you to hold out the whole week without bodilysustenance; but it is sufﬁcient to fast two or three days;do this till I come again to you in a short time, when Iwill more fully show you what you are to do, and howlong to continue your penance.” Having so said, andprescribed the measure of his penance, the priest wentaway, and upon some sudden occasion passed over intoIreland, whence he derived his origin, and returned nomore to him, as he had appointed. Remembering thisinjunction and his own promise, he totally addicted himself to tears, penance, holy watching; and continence;so that he only fed on Thursdays and Sundays, as hasbeen said; and ate nothing all the other days of theweek. When he heard that his priest was gone toIreland, andrhad died there, he ever after observed thatsame abstinence, according to his direction; and as hehad begun that course through the fear of God, in penitence for his guilt, so he still continued the sameunremittingly for the Divine love, and in hope of his reward.Having practised this carefully for a long time, ithappened that he had gone on a certain day to a distance from the monastery, accompanied by one of thebrothers; and as they were returning from this journey,when they drew near to the monastery, and beheld itslofty buildings, the man of God burst out into tears, andhis countenance discovered the trouble of his heart. Hiscompanion, perceiving it, asked what was the reason, towhich he answered: “ The time is at hand, when a de</p>

The other, hearing thesewords, as soon as they came into the monastery, toldthem to Ebba, the mother of the congregation. She,with good c'ause, being much concerned at that prediction, called the man to her, and narrowly inquired ofhim how he came to know it. He answered, “Beingbusy one night lately in watching and singing psalms, Ion a sudden saw a person unknown standing by me, andbeing startled at his presence, he bade me not to fear,and speaking to me in a. familiar manner, ‘ You do well,said he, ‘ in that you spend this night-time of rest, notin giving yourself up to sleep, but in watching and prayer.’I answered, ‘ I know I have great need of wholesomewatching, and earnest praying to our Lord to pardonmy trangressions.’ He replied, ‘ You are in the right,for you and many more do need to redeem their sins bygood works, and when they cease from labouring abouttemporal aﬁ'airs, then to labour the more eagerly for thedesire of heavenly goods; but this very few do; for I,having now visited all this monastery regularly, havelooked into every one’s chambers and beds, and foundnone of them all besides yourself busy about the care ofhis soul; but all of them, both men and women, eitherindulge themselves in slothful sleep, or are awake in orderto commit sin; for even the cells that were built forpraying or reading, are now converted into places offeasting, drinking, talking, and other delights; the veryvirgins dedicated to God, laying aside the respect dueto their profession, whensoever they are at leisure, applythemselves to weaving ﬁne garments, either to use inadorning themselves like brides, to the danger of theircondition, or to gain the friendship of strange men; forwhich reason, a heavy judgment from heaven is deservedly ready to fall on this place and its inhabitants bydevouring ﬁre.”’ .

This vision being divulged abroad, the inhabitants of that place were for a few days in some littlefear, and leaving off their sins, began to punish themselves; but after the abbess’s death, they returned totheir former wickedness, nay, they became more wicked;and when they thought themselves in peace and security,they soon felt the effects of the aforesaid judgment.That all this fell out thus, was told me by my mostreverend fellow—priest, Edgils, who then lived in thatmonastery. Afterwards, when many of the inhabitantshad departed thence, on account of the destruction, helived a long time in our monastery, and died there.

His friends, ashas been said, advised him not to engage in this war;but he having the year before refused to listen to themost reverend father, Egbert, advising him not to attackthe Scots, who did him no harm, it was laid upon him asa punishment for his sin, that he should not now regardthose who would have prevented his death.From that time the hopes and strength of the Englishcrown “ began to waver, and retrograde ;” for the Pictsrecovered their own lands, which had been held by theEnglish and the Scots that were in Britain, and some ofthe Britons their liberty, which they have now enjoyedfor about forty-six years.

          <p>CHAP. XXVII.—CUTHBEBT, A MAN OF GOD, Is MADEBISHOP; AND HOW HE LIVED AND TAUGHT WHILST STILLIN A MONASTIC LIFE. _HE same year that King'ngrid OfBilhopdeparted this life, he (as has been 2133ngsaid) promoted to the bishopric ofthe church of Lindisfarne, the holyand venerable Cuthbert, who had formany years led a solitary life, ingreat continence of body and mind,in a very small island, called Fame,distant ahnost nine miles from that same church, in theocean. From his very childhood he had always been inﬂamed with the desire of a religious life ; but he took uponhim the habit and name of a. monk when he was a youngman: he ﬁrst entered into the monastery of Melros,which is on the bank of the river Twede, and was thengoverned by the Abbot Eata, a meek and simple man,who was afterwards made bishop of the church of Hagulstad or Lindisfarne, as has been said above, over whichmonastery at that time was placed Boisil, a priest ofgreat virtue and of a prophetic spirit. Cuthbert, humblysubmitting himself to this man’s direction, from himreceived both the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, andexample of good works. "After he had departed to our Lord, Cuthbert wasplaced over that monastery, where he instructed many inregular life, both by the authority of a master, and theexample of his own behaviour. Nor did he afford admonitions and an example of a regular life to his monastery alone, but endeavoured to convert the people roundabout far and near from the life of foolish custom,to the love of heavenly joys; for many profaned thefaith which they had received by their wicked actions;and some also, in the time of a. mortality, neglecting the91—"&amp;f7];</p>

Inorder to correct the error of both sorts, he often wentout of the monastery, sometimes on horseback, butoftener on foot, and repaired to the neighbouring towns,where he preached the way of truth to such as weregone astray ; which had been also done by Boisil in histime. It was then the custom of the English people,that when a clerk or priest came into the town, they all,at his command, ﬂocked together to hear the word;willingly heard what was said, and more willingly practised those things that they could hear or understand.But Cuthbert was so skilful an orator, 'so fond was he ofenforcing his subject, and such a brightness appeared inhis angelic face, that no man present presumed to conceal from him the most hidden secrets of his heart, butall openly confessed what they had done; because theythought the same could not be concealed from him, andwiped off the guilt of What they had so confessed withworthy fruits of penance, as he commanded. He waswont chieﬂy to resort to those places, and preach insuch villages, as being seated high up amid craggy uncouth mountains, were frightful to others to behold, andwhose poverty and barbarity rendered them inaccessibleto other teachers ; which nevertheless he, having entirelydevoted himself to that pious labour, did so industriouslyapply himself to polish with his doctrine, that when hedeparted out of his monastery, he would often stay a,week, sometimes two or three, and sometimes a. wholemonth, before he returned home, continuing among themountains to allure that rustic people by his preachingand example to heavenly employments.This venerable servant of our Lord, having thus spentmany years in the monastery of Melros, and therebecome conspicuous by many miracles, his most reverend</p>

Whenhe had there, after expelling the enemies, with theassistance of the brethren, built himself a small dwelling,with a. trench about it, and the necessary cells, and anoratory, he ordered the brothers to dig a. pit in the ﬂoorof the dwelling, although the ground was hard andstony, and no hopes appeared of any spring. Havingdone this upon the faith and at the request of theservant of God, the next day it appeared full of water,and to this day affords plenty of its heavenly bounty toall that resort thither. He also desired that all instruments for husbandry might be brought him, and somewheat; and having sown the same at the proper season,neither stalk, nor so much as a leaf, sprouted from it bythe next summer. Hereupon the brethren visiting himaccording to custom, he ordered barley to be broughthim, in case it were either the nature of the soil, or theDivine will, that such grain should rather grow there.He sowed it in the same ﬁeld just as it was broughthim, after the proper time of sowing, and consequentlywithout any likelihood of its coming to good: but a.plentiful crop immediately came up, and afforded theman of God the means which he had so ardently desiredof supporting himself by his own labour.When he had here served God in solitude many years,the mound which encompassed his habitation being sohigh, that he could from thence see nothing but heaven,to which he so ardently aspired, it happened that a greatsynod was assembled in the presence of King ngrid,</p>

They could not, however, persuade himto leave his monastery, though many messengers andletters were sent to him; 'at last the aforesaid kinghimself, with the most holy Bishop Trumwine, and otherreligious and great men, passed over into the island;many also of the brothers of the same isle of Lindisfarneassembled together for the same purpose: they all knelt,conjured him by our Lord, and with tears and entreaties,till they drew him, also in tears, from his retreat, andforced him to the synod. Being arrived there, aftermuch opposition, he was overcome by the unanimousresolution of all present,‘and submitted to take uponhimself the episcopal dignity; being chieﬂy prevailedupon by the mention that Boisil, the servant of God,when he had prophetically foretold all things that wereto befall him, had also predicted that he should be a.bishop. However, the consecration was not appointedimmediately; but after the winter, which was then athand, it was performed at Easter, in the city of York,and in the presence of the aforesaid King ngrid ; sevenbishops meeting on the occasion, among whom, Theodore, of blessed memory, was primate. He was ﬁrstelected bishop of the church of Hagulstad,- in the placeof Tunbert, who had been deposed from the episcopaldignity; but in regard that he chose rather to be placedover the church of Lindisfarne, in which he had lived,it was thought ﬁt that Eata should return to the see ofthe church of Hagulstad, to which he had been ﬁrstordained, and that Cuthbert should take upon him thegovernment of the church of Lindisfarne.Following the example of the apostles, he becamean ornament to the episcopal dignity, by his virtuousactions; for be both protected the people committed to</p>

However, at length yielding totheir entreaties, he consented to be carried back to theisle of Lindisfarne, and there buried in the church.This being done accordingly, the venerable Bishop Wilfrid held the episcopal see of that church one year, tillsuch time as one was chosen to be ordained in the roomof Cuthbert. Afterwards Eadbert was censecrated, a.man renowned for his knowledge in the Divine writings,as also for keeping the Divine precepts, and chieﬂy foralmsgiving, so that, according to the law, he every yeargave the tenth part, not only of four-footed beasts, butalso of all com and fruit, as also of garments, to thepoor.</p>

They acquainted BishopEadbert with their design, and he consented to it, andordered that the same should be done on the anniversary of his burial. They did so, and opening the grave,found all the body whole, as if it had been alive, andthe joints pliable, more like one asleep than a. dead person; besides, all the vestments the body had on werenot only found, but wonderful for their freshness andgloss. The brothers seeing this, with much amazementhastened to tell the bishop what they had found; hebeing then alone in a. place remote from the church, andencompassed by the sea.

Soon after, God’s belovedbishop, Eadbert, fell grievously sick, and his distemperdaily increasing, in a. short time, that is, on the 6thof May, he also departed to our Lord, and they laid hisbody in the grave of the holy father Cuthbert, placingthe cofﬁn over it, with the uncorrupted remains of thatfather.

When at last he got up, he felt one half of hisbody, from the head to the foot, struck with palsy, andwith much diﬂiculty got home by the help of a. staff.The -distemper increased by degrees, and, as nightapproached, became still worse, so that when day returned, he could scarcely rise or go alone. In this weakcondition, a good thought came into his mind, whichwas to go to the church, the best way he could, to the"tomb of the reverend father Cuthbert, and there, on hisknees, to beg of the Divine Goodness either to be delivered from that disease, if it were for his good, or if theDivine Providence had ordained him longer to lie underthe same for his punishment, that he might hear the painwith patience and a composed mind.He did accordingly, and supporting his weak limbswith a. staﬁ', entered the church, and prostrating himselfbefore the body of the man of God, he, with piousearnestness, prayed, that through his intercession, ourLord might be propitious to him. In the midst of hisprayers, he fell as it were into a stupor, and, as he wasafterwards wont to relate, felt a. large and broad handtouch his head, where the pain lay, and by that touch,all the part of his body which had been affected with thedistemper, was delivered from the weakness, and restored .to health down to his feet. He then awoke, and rose upin perfect health, and returning thanks to God for his recovery, told the brothers what had happened to him; andto the joy of them all, returned the more zealously, as ifchastened by his afﬂiction, to the service which he waswont before so carefully to perform. The very garmentswhich had been on Cuthbert’s body, dedicated to God,either whilst living, or after he was dead, were notexempt from the virtue of performing cures, 'as may be</p>

Ithappened in the monastery, which being built near theriver Dacore, has taken its name from the same, overwhich, at that time, the religious Suidbert presided asabbot. In that monastery was a youth whose eyelid hada great swelling on it, which growing daily, threatenedthe loss of the eye. The surgeons applied their medicines to ripen it, but in vain. Some said it ought to becut off ; others opposed it, for fear of worse consequences. The brother, having long laboured under thismalady, and seeing no human means likely to save hiseye, but that, on the contrary, it grew daily worse, wascured on a sudden, through the Divine Goodness, by therelics of the holy father, Cuthbert; for the brethren,ﬁnding his body uncorrupted, after having been manyyears buried, took some part of the hair, which theymight, at the request of friends, give or show, in testimony of the miracle.One of the priests of the monastery, named Thridred,who is now abbot there, had a small part of these relicsby him at that time. One day in the church he openedthe box of relics, to give some part to a friend thatbegged it, and it happened that the youth who had thedistempered eye was then in the church; the priest,having given his friend as much as he thought ﬁt, de-~livered the rest to the youth to put it into its place.Having received the hairs of the holy head, by somefortunate impulse, he clapped them to the sore eyelid,and endeavoured for some time, by the application of</p>

It was then, as he is wontto relate it, about the second hour of the day; but he,being busy about other things that belonged to that day,about the sixth hour of the same, touching his eye on asudden, found it as sound with the lid, as if there neverhad been any swelling or deformity on it.</p>

Butlooking out as far as we could see, we observed, on theisland of Fame, Father Ethelwald, beloved of God,come out of his cavern to watch our course, for, hearingthe noise of the storm and raging sea, he was come outto see what would become of us. When he beheld usin distress and despair, he bowed his knees to theFather of our Lord J esus Christ, in prayer for our lifeand safety; upon which, the swelling sea was calmed,so that the storm ceased on all sides, and a fair windattended us to the very shore. When we had landed,and had dragged upon the shore the small vessel thatbrought us, the storm, which had ceased a. short timefor our sake, immediately returned, and raged continuallyduring the whole day; so that it plainly appeared thatthe brief cessation of the storm had been granted fromHeaven, at the request of the man of God, in order thatwe might escape.”The man of God remained in the isle of Fame twelve Buried aL ndiufarne.years, and died there; but was buried in the church of AlD- 699St. Peter End Paulïpn the isle of Lindisfarne, besidethe bodies of the aforesaid bishops.

There is a certain buildingin a retired situation, and enclosed by a narrow woodand a. trench, about a mile and a. half from the churchof Hagulstad, and separated from it by the river Tyne,having a burying-place dedicated to St. Michael theArchangel, where the man of God used frequently, asoccasion oﬁ‘ered, and particularly in Lent, to reside witha few companions. Being come thither once at thebeginning of Lent, to stay, he commanded his followersto ﬁnd out some poor person labouring under anygrievous inﬁrmity, or want, whom he might keep withhim during those days, by way of alme, for so he wasalways used to do.There was in a village not far off, a. certain dumb glemcgrxuam'youth, known to the bishop, for he often used to comeinto his presence to receive alma, and who had neverbeen able to speak one word. Besides, he had so muchsc'urf and scabs on his head, that no hair ever grew onthe top of it, but only some scattered hairs in &amp; circleround about. The bishop caused this man to bebrought, and a little cottage to be made him within theenclosure of the dwelling, in which he might reside, andM2</p>

When one week A.D.GSG.of Lent was over, the next Sunday he caused the poorman to come in to him, and ordered him to put histongue out of his mouth and show it him; then layinghold of his chin, he made the sign of the cross on histongue, directing him to draw it back into his mouthand to speak. “ Pronounce some word,” said he; “ sayyea,” which, in the language of the Angles, is the wordof afﬁrming and consenting, that is, yes. His tonguebeing loosed, he immediately said what he was ordered.The bishop, then pronouncing the names of the letters,directed him to say A; he did so, and afterwards B,which he also did. When he had named all the lettersafter the bishop, the latter proceeded to put syllablesand words to him, which being also repeated by him, hecommanded him to utter Whole sentences, and he did it.Nor did he cease all that day and the next night, aslong as he could keep awake, as those who were presentrelate, to talk something, and to express his privatethoughts arid will to others, which he could never dobefore; after the manner of the cripple, who, beinghealed by the Apostles Peter and J ohn, stood up leaping, and walked, and went with them into the temple,walking, and skipping, and praising the Lord, rejoicingto have the use of his feet, which he had so long wanted.The bishop, rejoicing at his recovery of speech, orderedthe physician to take in hand the cure of his scurfedhead. He did so, and with the help of the bishop’sblessing and prayers, at good head of hair grew as theﬂesh was healed. Thus the youth obtained a goodaspect, a ready utterance, and a. beautiful head of hair,whereas before he had been deformed, poor, and dumb.Thus rejoicing at his recovery, the bishop offered tokeep him in his family, but he rather chose to returnhome.</p>

The abbessentreated the bishop that he would vouchsafe to go inand give her his blessing; for that she believed shewould be the better for his blessing or touching her. Heasked when the maiden had been bled? and being toldthat it was on the fourth day of the moon, said, ‘ Youdid very indiscreetly and unskilfully to bleed her on thefourth day of the moon; for I remember that ArchbishopTheodore, of blessed memory, said, that bleeding at thattime was very dangerous, when the light of the moon andthe tide of the ocean is increasing; and what can Ido to the girl if she is like to die ?'“ The abbess still earnestly entreated for her daughter,whom she dearly loved, and designed to make abbess inher stead, and at last prevailed with him to go in to her.He accordingly went in, taking me with him to the</p>

Having seated myself downby her, she said, ‘ Would you like me to call for something to drink?’—‘Yes,’ said I, ‘and am very glad ifyou can.’ When the cup was brought, and we hadboth drunk, she said, "As. soon as the bishop had saidthe prayer, given me his blessing, and gone out, I immediately began to 'mend; and though I have not yet recovered my former strength, yet all the pain is quitegone from my arm, where it was most intense, and fromall my body, as if the bishop had carried it away withhim; though the swelling of the am still seems to remain." When we departed from thence, the cure of thepain in her limbs was followed by the assuaging of theswelling; and the virgin being thus delivered from torture and death, returned praise to our Lord and Saviour,with his other servants who were there.”CHAP.

It happened that the man A-D-686of God was, at that time, invited thither by the earl toconsecrate a church; and when that was done, the earl,desired him to dine at his house. The bishop declined,saying, “He must return to the monastery, which wasvery near.” The earl pressing him more earnestly,vowed he would also give alms to the poor, if the bishopwould break his fast that day in his house. I joined myentreaties to his, promising in like manner to give almafor the relief of the poor, if he would go and dine at theearl’s house, and give his blessing. Having at length,with much difﬁculty, prevailed, we went in to dine. Thebishop had sent to the woman that lay sick some of theholy water, which he had blessed for the consecration ofthe church, by one of the brothers that went along withme, ordering him to give her some to drink, and washthe place where her greatest pain was, with some of thesame. This being done, the woman immediately got upin health, and perceiving that she had not only been delivered from her tedious distemper, but at the same timerecovered the strength which she had lost, she presentedthe cup to the bishop and to us, and continued servingus with drink as she had begun till dinner was over;following the example of Peter’s mother-in—law, who,having been sick of a fever, arose at the touch of ourLord, and having at once received health and strength,ministered to them.”</p>

The ear] urged hisentreaties with tears, earnestly praying that he wouldgo in and pray for him, because his life was of great consequence to him; and he believed that if the bishopwould lay his hand upon him and give him his blessing,he would soon mend. The bishop went in, and saw himin a dying condition, and the cofﬁn by his side, whilst allthat were present were in tears. He said a prayer,blessed him, and on going out, as is the usual expressionof comforters, said, “May you soon recover.” Afterwards, when they were sitting at table, the lad sent tohis lord, to desire he would let him have a cup of wine,because he was thirsty. The earl, rejoicing that hecould drink, sent him a cup of wine, blessed by thebishop ; which, as soon as he had drunk, he immediatelygot up, and, shaking off his late inﬁrmity, dressed himself, and going in to the bishop, saluted him and theother guests, saying, “ He would also eat and be merryWith them.” They ordered him to sit down with themat the entertainment, rejoicing at his recovery. He satedown, ate and drank merrily, and behaved himself likethe rest of the company; and living many years after,continued in the same state of health.

"self, is to be passed over in silence. »He being then one A'D'm'of that bishop’s clergy, now presides as abbot in the monastery at the mouth of the river Tyne. “Being present,” said he, “ and very well acquainted with hiscourse of life, I found it to be most worthy of a bishop,as far as it is lawful for men to judge; but I have knownby the experience of others, and more particularly by myown, how great his merit was before Him who is thejudge of the heart; having been by his prayer and blessing brought back from the gates of death to the way oflife. ' For, when in the prime of my youth, I lived amonghis clergy, applying myself to reading and singing, butnot having yet altogether withdrawn my heart fromyouthful pleasures, it happened one day that as we weretravelling with him, we came into a. plain and open road,well adapted for galloping our horses. The young menthat were with him, and particularly those of the laity,began to entreat the bishop to give them leave to gallop,and make trial of the goodness of their horses. He atﬁrst refused, saying, ‘it was an idle request;’ but atlast, being prevailed on by the unanimous desire of somany, ‘ Do so,’ said be, ‘if you will, but let I-Ierebaldhave no part in the trial.’ I earnestly prayed that Imight have leave to ride with the rest, for I relied on anexcellent horse, which he had given me, but I could notobtain my request.“ When they had several times galloped backwards andforwards, the bishop and I looking on, my wanton humour prevailed, and I could no longer refrain, but thoughhe forbade me, I struck in among them, and began to</p>

It was about the seventh hourof the day, and having lain still, and as it were dead fromthat time till the evening, I then revived a little, and wascarried home by my companions, but lay speechless all thenight, vomiting blood, because something was brokenwithin me by the fall. The bishop was very much grievedat my misfortune, and expected my death, for he bore meextraordinary affection. Nor would he stay that night,as he was wont, among his clergy; but spent it all inwatching and prayer alone, imploring the Divine goodness,as I imagine, for my health. Coming to me in the morning early, and having said a prayer over me, he called meby my name, and as it were waking me out of a heavysleep, asked ‘ Whether I knew who it was that spoke tome?' I opened my eyes and said, ‘I do; you are mybeloved bishop.’-—-‘ Can you live ?' said he. I answered, .‘ I may, through your prayers, if it shall please our Lord.’“ He then laid his hand on my head, with the wordsof blessing, and retumed to prayer; when he came againto see me, in a short time, he found me sitting and ableto talk; and, being induced by Divine instinct, as it soonappeared, began to ask me, ‘ Whether I knew for certainN</p>

He called thesurgeon, and ordered him to close and bind up my skullwhere it was cracked; and having then received hisblessing, I was so much better that I mounted on horseback the next day, and travelled with him to anotherplace; and being soon after perfectly recovered, I received the baptism of life.”He continued in his see thirty—three years, and then Ethelwnldascending to the heavenly kingdom, was buried in St. :]? 721.Peter’s Porch, in his own monastery, called Inderawood,in the year of our Lord's incarnation 721.

There are also inthe same parts many other nations still following paganrites, to whom the aforesaid soldier of Christ designed torepair, sailing round Britain, and to try whether he coulddeliver any of them from Satan, and bring them over toChrist; or if this could not be done, to go to Rome, tosee and adore the hallowed thresholds of the holy apostlesand martyrs of Christ. 'But the Divine oracles and certain events proceedingfrom heaven obstructed his performing either of thosedesigns; for when he had made choice of some mostcourageous companions, ﬁt to preach the word of God, asbeing renowned for their learning and virtue; when allthings were provided for the voyage, there came to himon a. certain day in the morning one of the brethren,formerly disciple and minister in Britain to the belovedpriest of God, Boisil, when the said Boisil was superiorof the monastery of Mailros, under the Abbot Eata, ashas been said above. This brother told him the visionwhich he had seen that night. “. When after themorning hymns,” said he, “ I had laid me down in mybed, and was fallen into a slumber, my former master,and loving tutor, Boisil, appeared to me, and asked,‘ Whether I knew him ? I said, ‘ I do; you are Boisil.1He answered, ‘ I am come to bring Egbert a messagefrom our Lord and Saviour, which nevertheless must bedelivered to him by you. Tell him, therefore, that hecannot perform the journey he has undertaken; for it isthe will of God that he should rather go to instruct themonasteries of Columba!" Now Columba. was the ﬁrstteacher of Christianity to the Picts beyond the mountains northward, and the founder of the monastery in theisland Hii, which was for a. long time much honoured bymany tribes of the Scots and Picts; and which is nowby some called Columbkill, the name being compoundedfrom Columb and Cell. Egbert, having heard the vision,</p>
          <p>verba. visionis Egbertus præcepit fratri, qui retulerat, necuiquam hæc alteri referret, ne forte illusoria esset visio.Ipse autem tacitus rem considerans veram esse timebat;nec tamen a. præparando itinere, quo ad gentes docendasiret, cessare volebat.At post dies paucos rursum venit ad eum præfatusfrater, dicens quia. et ea nocte sibi post expletas matutinas Boisil per visum apparuerit, dicens, “ Quare tamnegligenter ac tepide dixisti Egberto, quæ tibi dicendapræcepi? At nunc vade, et dic illi quia, velit nolit,debet ad monasteria Columbæ venire, quia. aratra. eorumnon recte incedunt, oportet autem eum ad rectum hæctramitem revocare." Qui hæc audiens denuo præcepitfratri, ne hæc cuiquam patefaceret. Ipse vero, tametsicertus est factus de visione, nihilominus tentavit iterdispositum cum fratribus memoratis incipere. Cumquejam navi imposuissent quæ tanti itineris necessitas poscebat, atque opportunos aliquot dies ventos exspectarent,facta est nocte quadam tam sæva tempestas, quæ perditisnonnulla ex parte his, quæ in navi erant, rebus, ipsam inlittus jacentem inter undas relinqueret; salvata sunt.tamen omnia, quæ erant Egberti et sociorum ejus.Tum ipse quasi propheticum illud dicens, “ Quia propterme est tempestas hæc," subtraxit se illi profectioni, etremanere domi passus est.At vero unus de sociis ejus, vocabulo Wictbertus,cum esset et ipse contemtu mundi ac doctrinæ scientiainsignis, (nam multos annos in Hibernia peregrinusanachoreticam in magna perfectione vitam egerat,) ascendit. navem, et Fresiam perveniens duobus annis continuis genti illi ac regi ejus Rathbedo verbum salutisprædicabat, neque aliquem tanti laboris fructum apudbarbaros invenit auditores. Tunc reversus ad dilectælocum peregrinationis, solito in silentio vacare Dominocoepit; et quoniam externis prodesse ad ﬁdem nonpoterat, suis amplius ex virtutum exemplis prodessecurabat.</p>
          <p>ordered the brother that had told it him, not to mention A-D-689it to any other, lest it should happen to be an illusion.However, when he considered of it with himself, he apprehended that it was real; yet would not desist frompreparing for his voyage to instruct those nations.A few days after the aforesaid brother came again tohim, saying, “ That Boisil had that night again appearedto him after matins, and said, ‘ Why did you tell Egbertthat which I enjoined you in so light and cold a manner?However, go now and tell him, that whether he Will orno, he shall go to Columb’s monastery, because theirploughs do not go straight; and he is to bring theminto the right way.’ ” Hearing this, Egbert again commanded the brother not to reveal the same to any person. Though now assured of the vision, he neverthelessattempted to undertake his intended voyage with thebrethren. When they had put aboard all that wasrequisite for so long a voyage, and had waited some daysfor a fair wind, there arose one night on a sudden soviolent a storm, that the ship was run aground, and partof what had been put aboard spoiled. However, all thatbelonged to Egbert and his companions was saved.Then he, saying, like the prophet, “ This tempest hashappened upon my account,” laid aside the undertakingand stayed at home.However, Wictbert, one of his companions, beingfamous for his contempt of the world and for his knowledge, for he had lived many years a stranger in Ireland,leading an eremitical life in great purity, went abroad,and arriving in Frisland, preached the word of salvationfor the space of two years successively to that nationand to its king, Rathbed; but reaped no fruit of all hisgreat labour among his barbarous auditors. Returningthen to the beloved place of his peregrination, he gavehimself up to our Lord in his wonted repose, and sincehe could not be proﬁtable to strangers by teaching themthe faith, he took care to be the more useful to his ownpeople by the example of his virtue.</p>

Theyarrived there, twelve in number, and turning aside toPepin, duke of the Franks, were graciously received byhim; and as he had lately subdued the Hither Frisland,and expelled King Rathbed, he sent them thither topreach, supporting them at the same time with hisauthority, that none might molest them in their preaching, and bestowing many favours on those who consented 'to embrace the faith. Thus it came to pass, that withthe assistance of the Divine grace, they in a. short timeconverted many from idolatry to the faith of Christ.Two other priests of the English nation, who hadlong lived strangers in Ireland, for the sake of theeternal kingdom, following the example of the former,went into the province of the Ancient Saxons, to trywhether they could there gain any to Christ by preaching. They both bore the same name, as they were thesame in devotion, Hewald being the name of both, withthis distinction1 that, on account of the difference oftheir hair, the one was called Black Hewald and theWxf.!other White Hewald. They were both piously religious, maﬁa.but Black Hewald was the more learned of the two in BlackScripture.

He was alsodesirous there to learn or to receive from thence manyother things which so great a work required.- Havingobtained all that he wanted, he returned to preach.At which time, the brothers who were in Frisiand,attending the ministry of the word, chose out of theirown number a man, modest of behaviour, and meek ofheart, called Suidbert, to be ordained bishop for them.He, being sent into Britain, was consecrated by themost reverend Bishop Wilfrid, who, happening to bethen driven out of his country, lived in banishmentamong the Mercians; for Kent had no bishop at thattime, Theodore being dead, and Berthwald, his successor,who was gone beyond the sea, to be ordained, not havingreturned. 'The said Suidbert, being made bishop, returned fromBritain not long after, and went among the Boructuarians; and by his preaching brought many of theminto the way of truth; but the Boructuarians being notlong after subdued by the Ancient Saxons, those whohad received the word were dispersed abroad; and thebishop himself repaired to Pepin, who, at the requestof his wife, Blithryda, gave him a place of residence ina certain island on the Rhine, which, in their tongue, iscalled Inlitore; where he built a monastery, which hisheirs still possess, and for a time led a most continentlife, and there ended his days.When they who went over had spent some yearsteaching in Frisland, Pepin, with the consent of themall, sent the venerable Wilbrord to Rome, where Sergiuswas still pope, desiring that he might be consecratedarchbishop over the nation of the Frisons; which wasaccordingly done, in the year of our Lord’s incarnation696. He was consecrated in the church of the HolyMartyr Cecilia, on her feast-day; the pope gave himthe name of Clement, and sent him back to his bishopric,fourteen days after his arrival at Rome.</p>

There was a. master of a.family in that district of the Northumbrians, which iscalled Cuningham, who led a. religious life, as did alsoall that belonged to him.

He, comforting her, said, “ Fearnot, for I am now truly risen'from death, and permittedagain to live among men; however, I am not to livehereafter as I was wont, but from henceforward after avery diﬁ‘erent manner.” Then rising immediately, berepaired to the oratory of the little town, and continuingin prayer till day, immediately divided all his substanceinto three parts ; one whereof he gave to his wife,another to his children, and the third, belonging to himself, he instantly distributed among the poor. Not longafter he repaired to the monastery of Melros, which isalmost enclosed by the winding of the river Twede, andhaving been shaven, went into a. private dwelling, whichthe abbot had provided, Where he continued till the dayof his death, in such extraordinary contrit-ion of mindand body, that though his tongue had been silent, hislife declared that he had seen many things either to bedreaded or coveted, which others knew nothing of.Thus he related what he had seen. “ He that led mehada shining countenance and a bright garment, andwe went on silently, as I thought, towards the northeast. Walking on, we came to a vale of great breadthand depth, but of inﬁnite length; on the left it appearedfull of dreadful ﬂames, the other side was no less horridfor violent hail and cold snow ﬂying in all directions;both places were full of men’s souls, which seemed by' turns to be tossed from one side to the other, as it wereby a. violent storm; for when the wretches could nolonger endure the excess of heat, they leaped into themiddle of the cutting cold; and ﬁnding no rest there,- they leaped back again into the middle of the unquenchable ﬂames. N ow whereas an innumerable multitude ofdeformed spirits were thus alternately tormented farand near, as far as could be seen, without any intermission, I began to think that this perhaps might be hell,</p>
          <p>cujus tormentis intolerabilibus narrare sæpius audivi.Respondit cogitationi meæ ductor, qui me præcedebat;‘ Non hoc,’ inquiens, ‘ suspiceris; non enim hic infernusest ille, quem putas.’“ At cum me hoc spectaculo tam horrendo perterritumpaulatim in ulteriora produceret, vidi subito ante nos obscurari incipere loca, et tenebris omnia. repleri. Quascum intraremus, in tantum paulisper condensatae sunt, utnihil præter ipsas aspicerem, excepta duntaxat specie etveste ejus, qui me ducebat. Et cum progrederemur sola.sub nocte per umbras, ecce, subito apparent ante noscrebri flammarum tetrarum globi, ascendentes quasi deputeo magno, rursumque decidentes in eundem. Quocum perductus essem, repente ductor meus disparuit, acme solum in medio tenebrarum et horrendæ visionisreliquit. At cum iidem globi ignium sine intermissionemodo alta peterent, modo ima barathri repeterent, cernoomnia, quæ ascendebant, fastigia. ﬂammarum plena essespiritibus hominum, qui instar favillarum cum fumoascendentium nunc ad sublimiora projicerentur, nuncretractis ignium vaporibus relaberentur in profundum.Sed et foetor incomparabilis cum eisdem vaporibus ebulliens, omnia illi tenebrarum loca replebat.“Et cum diutius ibi pavidus consisterem, utpote in.certus quid agerem, quo verterem gressum, qui me ﬁnismaneret; audio subito post terga, sonitum immanissimiﬂetus ac miserrimi, simul et cachinnum crepitantem,quasi vulgi indocti captis hostibus insultantis.

          <p>of whose intolerable ﬂames I had often heard talk. My A.D. 696.guide, who went before me, answered to my thought,saying, ‘ Do not believe so, for this is not the hell youimagine.’“ When he had conducted‘ me, much frightened withthat harrid spectacle, by degrees, to the farther end,on a sudden I saw the place begin to grow dusk andﬁlled with darkness. When I came into it, the darkness, by degrees, grew so thick, that I could see nothingbesides it and the shape and garment of him that led me.As we went on through the shades of night, on a suddenthere appeared before us frequent globes of black ﬂames,rising as it were out of a great pit, and falling back againinto the same. When I had been conducted thither,my leader suddenly vanished, and left me alone in themidst of darkness and this horrid vision, whilst thosesame globes of ﬁre, without intermission, at one time'ﬂew up and at another fell back into the bottom of theabyss; and I observed that all the ﬂames, as theyascended, were full of human souls, which, like sparksﬂying up with smoke, were sometimes thrown on high,and again, when the vapour of the ﬁre ceased, droppeddown into the depth below. Moreover, an insufferablestench came forth with the vapours, and ﬁlled all thosedark places.“ Having stood there a long time in much dread, notknowing what to do, which way to turn, or what end Imight expect, on a sudden I heard behind me the noiseof a most hideous and wretched lamentation, and at thesame time a loud laughing, as of a rude multitude insulting captured enemies. When that noise, growingplainer, came up to me, I observed a gang of evil spiritsdragging the howling and lamenting souls of men intothe midst of the darkness, whilst they themselves laughedand rejoiced. Among those men, as I could discern,there was one shorn like a clergyman, a layman, and awoman. The evil spirits that dragged them went down</p>
          <p>runt in medium barathri illius ardentis; factumque est,ut cum longius subeuntibus eis, fletum hominum et risumdæmoniorum clare discernere nequirem, sonum tamenadhuc promiscuum in auribus haberem. Interea ascenderunt quidam spirituum obscurorum de abysso illa ﬂammivoma, et accurrentes circumdederunt me, atque oculisﬂammantibus et de ore ac naribus ignem putidum eﬂian—tes angebant; forcipibus quoque igneis, quos tenebantin manibus, minitabantur me comprehendere, nec tamenme ullatenus contingere, tametsi terrere praesumebant.Qui cum undiqueversum hostibus et caecitate tenebratumconclusus huc illucque oculos circumferrem, si forte alicunde quid auxilii, quo salvarer, adveniret, apparuit retrovia, qua veneram, quasi fulgor stellæ micantis inter tenebras, qui paulatim crescens et ad me ocius festinans ubiappropinquavit, dispersi sunt et aufugerunt omnes, quime forcipibus rapere quærebant; spiritus infesti.“ Ille autem, qui adveniens eos fugavit, erat ipse, quime ante ducebat; qui mox conversus ad dexterum iter,quasi contra ortum solis brumalem, me ducere coepit.Nec mora exemptum tenebris in auras me serenæ luciseduxit; cumque me in luce aperta duceret, vidi ante nosmurum permaximum, cujus neque longitudini hinc velinde, neque altitudini, ullus esse terminus videretur.Coepi autem mirari quare ad murum accederemus, cumin eo nullam januam, vel fenestram, vel ascensum, alicubiconspicerem. Cum ergo pervenissemus ad murum, statim nescio quo ordine fuimus in summitate ejus. Etecce, ibi campus erat latissimus ac laetissimus, tantaquefragrantia vernantium flosculorum plenus, ut omnem moxfoetorem tenebrosæ fornacis, qui me pervaserat, eﬁ'ugaretadmirandi hujus suavitas odoris. Tanta autem luxcuncta ea loca, perfuderat, ut omni splendore diei, sivesolis meridiani radiis, videretur esse præclarior. Erantque in hoc campo innumera hominum albatorum conventicula, sedesque plurimæ agminum laetantium. Cumque</p>
          <p>into the midst of the burning pit; and as they went A.D. 696.down deeper, I could no longer distinguish between thelamentation of the men and the laughing of the devils,yet I still had a confused sound in my ears. In themeantime, some of the dark spirits ascended from thatﬂaming abyss, and running forward, beset me on allsides, and much perplexed me with their glaring eyesand the stinking ﬁre which proceeded from their mouthsand nostrils; and threatened to lay hold on me withburning tongs, which they had in their hands, yet theydurst not touch me, though they frightened me. Beingthus on all sides enclosed With enemies and darkness,and looking about on every side for assistance, there appeared behind me, on the way that I came, as it were,the brightness of a star shining amidst the darkness;which increased by degrees, and came rapidly towardsme: when it drew near, all those evil spirits, that soughtto carry me away with their tongs, dispersed and ﬂed.“ He, whose approach put them to ﬂight, was thesame that had led me before; who, then turning towards the right, began to lead me, as it were, towardsthe south-east, and having soon brought me out of thedarkness, conducted me into an atmosphere of clear light.While he thus led me in open light, I saw a vast wall before us, the length and height of which, in every direction,seemed to be altogether boundless. I began to wonderwhy we went up to the wall, seeing no door, window, orpath through it. When we came to the wall, we were presently, I know not by what means, on the top of it, andwithin it was a. vast and delightful ﬁeld, so full of fragrantﬂowers that the odour of its delightful sweetness immediately dispelled the stink of the dark furnace, whichhad pierced me through and through. So great was thelight in this place, that it seemed to exceed the brightness of the day, or the sun in its meridian height. Inthis ﬁeld were-innumerable assemblies of men in white,and many companies seated together rejoicing. As he</p>
          <p>inter choros felicium incolarum medios me duceret, cogitare coepi quod hoc fortasse esset regnum cælorum, dequo prædicari sæpius audivi. Respondit ille cogitatuimeo ; ‘ Non,’ inquiens, ‘ non hoc est regnum caelorum,quod autumas.’ .“ Cumque procedentes transiissemus et has beatorummansiones spirituum, aspicio ante nos multo majorem 'luminis gratiam quam prius, in qua etiam vocem cantantium dulcissimam audivi, et odoris fragrantia miritanta de loco eﬁ'undebatur, ut is, quem antea degustansquasi maximum rebar, jam permodicus mihi odor videretur; sicut etiam lux illa. campi florentis eximiain compa—ratione ejus, quæ nunc apparuit, lucis, tenuissima prorsusvidebatur et parva.

Heanswered to my thought, saying, ‘ This is not the kingdom of heaven, as you imagine.’"' When we had passed those mansions of blessed soulsand gone farther on, I discovered before me a much morebeautiful light, and therein heard sweet voices of persons singing, and so wonderful a fragrancy proceeded _from the place, that the other which I had beforethought most delicious, then seemed to me but very indifferent; even as that extraordinary brightness of theﬂowery ﬁeld, compared with this, appeared mean and inconsiderable. When I began to hope we should enter that, delightful place, my guide, on a sudden, stood still; andthen turning back, led me back by the way we came.“ When we returned to those joyful mansions of thesouls in white, he said to me, ‘ Do you know what allthese things are which you have seen ?' I answered, Idid not; and then he replied, ‘ That vale you saw so-dreadful for consuming ﬂames and cutting cold, is theplace in which the souls of those are tried and punished,who, delaying to confess and amend their crimes, atlength have recourse to repentance at the point of death,and so depart this. life; but nevertheless because they,even at their death, confessed and repented, they shallall be received into the kingdom of heaven at the dayof judgment; but many are relieved before the day ofjudgment, by the prayers, alms, and fasting, of theliving, and more especially by masses. That ﬁery andstinking pit, which you saw, is the mouth of hell, intowhich whosoever falls shall never be delivered to alleternity.

As for you, who arenow to return to your body, and live among men again,if you will endeavour nicely to examine your actions,and direct your speech and behaviour in righteousnessand simplicity, you shall, after death, have a place ofresidence among these joyful troops of blessed souls; forwhen I left you for a while, it was to know how youwere to be disposed of.’ When he had said this to me,I much abhorred returning to my body, being delightedwith the sweetness and beauty of the place I beheld, andwith the company of those I saw in it. However, I duratnot ask him any questions; but in the meantime, on asudden, I found myself alive among men.”Now these and other things which this man of Godsaw, he would not relate to slothful persons and such aslived negligently ; but only to those who, being terriﬁedwith the dread of torments, or delighted with the hopesof heavenly joys, would make use of his words to advancein piety.

He often went tothat man, and asking several questions, heard of himall the particulare of what he had seen when separatedfrom his body; by whose relation we also came to theknowledge of those few particulars which we have brieﬂyset down.

And as thatplace lay on the bank of the river, he was wont often togo into the same to do penance in his body, and manytimes to dip quite under the water, and to continue saying psalms or prayers in the same as long as he couldendure it, standing still sometimes up to the middle, andsometimes to the neck in water; and when he went outfrom thence ashore, he never took off his cold and frozengarments till they grew warm and dry on his body. Andwhen in the winter the half-broken pieces of ice wereswimming about him, which he had himself broken, tomake room to stand or dip himself in the river, thosewho beheld it would say, “ It is wonderful, brother Drithelm, (for so he was called,) that you are able to enduresuch violent cold ;” he simply answered, for he was a.man of much simplicity and indifferent wit, “ I haveseen greater cold.” . And when they said, “ It is strangethat you will endure such austerity;” he replied, “ Ihave seen more austerity.” Thus he continued, throughan indefatigable desire of heavenly bliss, to subdue hisaged body with daily fasting, till the day of his beingcalled away; and he forwarded the salvation of many byhis words and example. ^</p>

In the reign of Coenred,1 who succeeded Ethelred, there wasa layman in a military employment,no less acceptable to the king for his worldly industrythan displeasing to him for his private neglect of himself.The king often admonished him to confess and amend,and to forsake his wicked courses, before he should loseall time for repentance and amendment by a suddendeath. Though frequently warned, “he despised thewords of salvation, and promised he would do penanceat some future time. In the meantime, falling sick, hewas conﬁned to his bed, and began to feel very severepains. The king coming to him (for he loved the man),earnestly exhorted him, even then, before death, to repent of his offences. He answered, “He would notthen confess his sins, but would do it when he wasrecovered of his sickness, lest his companions shouldupbraid him of having done that for fear of death, whichhe had refused to do in healt .” He thought he thenspoke very bravely, but it afterwards appeared that hehad been miserably deluded by the wiles of the Devil.The distemper still increasing, when the king cameagain to visit and instruct him, he cried out with alamentable voice, “What will you have now? Whatare you come for? for you can no longer do me anygood." The king answered, “ Do not talk so; behaveyourself like a man in his right mind.”—“ I" am not</p>

One of them produced a verysmall and most curious book, and gave it me to read;looking into it, I there found all the good actions I hadever done in my life, written down, and they were veryfew and inconsiderable. They took back the book andsaid nothing to me. Then, on a sudden, appeared anarmy of wicked and deformed spirits, encompassing thishouse without, and ﬁlling it within. Then he, who, bythe blackness of his dismal face, and his sitting abovethe rest, seemed to be the chief of them, taking out abook, horrid to behold, of a. prodigious size, and ofalmost insupportable weight, commanded one of hisfollowers to bring it to me to read. Having read it, Ifound therein most plainly written in black characters,all the crimes I ever committed, not only in word anddeed, but even in the least thought; and he said tothose men in white, who sat by me, ‘Why do you sithere, since you most certainly know that this man isours ?' They answered, ‘ You are in the right; take andadd him to the number of the damned.’ This said,they immediately vanished, and two most wicked spiritsrising, having forks in their hands, one of them struckme on the head, and the other on the foot. Thesestrokes are now with great torture penetrating throughmy bowels to the inward parts of my body, and as soonas they meet I shall die, and the devils being ready tosnatch me away, I shall be dragged into hell.”Thus talked that wretch in despair, and dying soonafter, he is now in vain suffering in eternal tormentsthat penance which he refused to suffer during a. shorttime, that he might obtain forgiveness.

His having books laid before him by thegood or evil spirits, was done by Divine dispensation,that we may keep in mind that our actions and thoughtsare not lost in the wind, but are all kept to be examinedby the Supreme Judge, and will in the end be shownus either by friendly or hostile angels. As to the angelsﬁrst producing a. white book, and then the devils a. blackone; the former a very small one, the latter one verylarge; it is to be observed, that in his ﬁrst years he didsome good actions, all which he nevertheless obscuredby the evil actions of his youth.

For which reasonit happened to him according to the saying, that he whowill not willingly and humbly enter the door of thechurch will certainly be damned, and enter the gate ofhell against his Will. For he falling sick, and beingreduced to extremity, called the brethren, and withmuch lamentation, and like one damned, began to tellthem, that he saw hell open, and Satan at the bottom{thereof ; as also Caiaphas, with the others that slew ourLord, by him delivered up to avenging ﬂames. “ Inwhose neighbourhood,” said he, “I see aplace of eternalperdition provided for me, miserable wretch.” Thebrothers, hearing these words, began seriously to exhorthim, that. he should repent even then whilst he was inthe ﬂesh. He answered in despair, “ I have Ino timenow to change my course of life, when I have myselfseen my judgment passed.”Whilst uttering these words, he died without havingreceived the saving viaticum, and his body was buried inthe remotest parts of the monastery, nor did any onedare either to say masses or sing psalms, or even to prayfor him. How far has our Lord divided the light fromdarkness! The blessed martyr, Stephen, being aboutto suffer death for the truth, saw the heavens open, theglory of God revealed, and J esus standing on the righthand of God.

It was built by the Emperor Constantine,in a. royal and magniﬁcent manner, on account of thecross of our Lord having been found there by his motherHelen.

XVII.—OF THE PLACE OF oun Lonns ASCENSION,AND THE TOMBB OF THE PATRIARCHS.ONCERNING the place of our A.D. 704.* ï Lord’s ascension, the aforesaid au, thor writes thus. “ Mount Olivet ish ' '4 equal in height to Mount Sion, butf exceeds it in breadth and length;and barley, for the nature of thatsoil is not calculated for bearing things of large or heavygrowth, but grass and ﬂowers. On the very top of it,where our Lord ascended into heaven, is a large roundchurch, having about it three vaulted porches. For theinner house could not be vaulted and covered, because ofthe passage of our Lord’s body; but it has an altar onthe east side, covered with a. narrow roof. In the midstof it are to be seen the last prints of our Lord‘s feet, thesky appearing open above where he ascended; and thoughthe earth is daily carried away by believers, yet still itremains as before, and retains the same impression of thefeet. Near this lies an iron wheel, as high as a. man’sneck, having an entrance towards the west, with a greatlamp hanging above it on a pulley, and burning nightand day. In the western part of the same church areeight windows; and eight lamps, hanging opposite tothem by cords, cast their light through the glass as faras J erusalem; this light is said to strike the hearts ofthe beholders with a sort. of joy and humility. Everyyear, on the day of the Ascension, when mass is ended, astrong blast of wind is said to come down, and to castto the ground all that are in the church.”Of the situation of Hebron, and the tombs of the fathers,he writes thus. “ Hebron, once the city and metropolisof David’s kingdom, now only showing what it was by its</p>

          <p>love of virtue, than by What he had gained from learning. A.D. 705.The most reverend prelate, Pechthelm, of whom weshall speak in the proper place, and who was a. longtime either deacon or monk with his successor Aldhelm,is wont to relate that many miraculous cures have beenwrought in the place where he died, through the meritof his sanctity; and that the men of that province usedto carry the dust from thence for the sick, which, whenthey had put into water, the sprinkling or drinkingthereof restored health to many sick men and beasts;so that the holy earth being frequently carried away,there was a. considerable hole left.Upon his death the bishopric of that province wasdivided into two dioceses. One of them was given toDaniel, which he governs to this day; the other toAldhelm, wherein he most worthily presided four years;both of them were well instructed, as well in ecclesiastical aﬁ‘airs as in the knowledge of the Scriptures.Aldhelm, when he was only a priest and abbot of themonastery of Malmesbury, by order of a synod of hisown nation, wrote a notable book against the error ofthe Britons, in not celebrating Easter at the propertime, and in doing several other things not consonant tothe purity and the peace of the church; and by thereading of this book be persuaded many of them, whowere subject to the West Saxons, to adopt the Catholiccelebration of our Lord’s resurrection. He likewisewrote a notable book on Virginity, which, in imitation ofSedulius, he composed double, that is, in hexameterverse and prOse. He wrote some other books, asbeinga. man most learned in all respects, for he had a cleanstyle, and was, as I have said, wonderful for ecclesiasticaland liberal erudition. On his death, Forthere was madebishop in his stead, and is living at this time, being likewise a man very learned in Holy Writ.Whilst they were bishops, it was decreed in a synod, 51:11:23: gmthat the province of the South Saxons, which till then Sussex.</p>

          <p>celebrated prelate, Wilfrid, died in the province of Inun— A.D. 709.dalum, after he had been bishop forty—ﬁve years. Hisbody, being laid in a cofﬁn, was carried to his monastery,called Ripon, and there buried in the church of theblessed Apostle Peter, with the honour due to so greata. prelate. We will now turn back, and brieﬂy mention 9: wuma’.some particulars of his life. Being a boy of a good 1:51.).m.disposition, and behaving himself worthily at that age,he conducted himself so modestly and discreetly in allrespects, that he was deservedly beloved, respected andcherished by his elders as one of themselves. At fourteenyears of age he preferred the monastic to the secularlife; which, when he had signiﬁed to his father, for hismother was dead, he readily consented to his heavenlywishes, and advised him to persist in his holy resolution.Accordingly he came to the isle of Lindisfame, and theregiving himself up to the service of the monks, he tookcare diligently to learn and to perform those things whichbelong to monastic purity and piety; and being of anacute understanding, he in a. very short time learned thepsalms and some books, before he was shorn, but when hewas already become very remarkable for the greater virtuesof humility and obedience: for which he was deservedlybeloved and respected by his equals and elders. Havingserved God some years in that monastery, and beinga clear—sighted youth, he observed that the way to virtuetaught by the Scots was not perfect, and be resolvedto go to Rome, to see what ecclesiastical or monasticrites were in use there. The brethren being madeacquainted therewith, commended his design, and advisedhim to put it into execution. He then repaired to A.D. 653.Queen Eanfled, to whom he was well known, and whohad got him into that monastery by her advice andassistance, and acquainted her that he was desirous tovisit the churches of the apostles. She, being pleasedwith the youth’s resolution, sent him into Kent, to KingEarconbert, who was her uncle’s son, requesting that he</p>

At A.D. 663.that time, Honorius, one of the disciples of the holyPope Gregory, and well instructed in ecclesiastical institutes, was archbishop there. Whilst he made somestay there, and being a youth of an active spirit, dili' gently applied himself to learn those things which heundertook, another youth, called Biscop, or otherwise A-D-664Benedict, of the English nobility, arrived there, beinglikewise desirous to go to Rome, of which we have.before made mention.The king gave him Wilfrid for a companion, withorders to conduct him to Rome. When they cameto Lyons, Wilfrid was detained there by Dalﬁn, thebishop of that city; but Benedict hastened on to Rome.That prelate was delighted with the youth’s prudentdiscourse, the gracefulness of his aspect, the alacrity ofhis behaviour, and the sedateness and gravity of histhoughts; for which reason he plentifully supplied himand his companions with all necessaries, as long as theystayed with him; and further offered to commit to himthe government of a considerable part of France, togive him a maiden daughter of his own brother to wife,and to receive him as his adopted son. He returnedthanks for the favour, which he was pleased to show toa stranger, and answered, that he had resolved uponanother course of life, and for that reason had left hiscountry and set out for Rome.Hereupon the bishop sent him to Rome, furnishinghim with a. guide and plenty of all things requisite forhis journey, earnestly requesting that he would comethat way when he returned into his own country. Wilfrid arriving at Rome, by constantly applying himself toprayer and the study of ecclesiastical aﬂ'airs, as he had' before proposed to himself, gained the friendship of themost holy and learned Boniface, the archdeacon, whowas also counsellor to the pope, by whose instruction heregularly learned the four Gospels, the true calculationR</p>

When he had spent some months there, insuccessful study, he returned into France, to Dalﬁn; A.D.sas.and having stayed with him three years, received fromhim the tonsure, and was so much beloved that he hadthoughts of making him his heir ; but this was preventedby the bishop’s untimely death, and Wilfrid was reserved A.D. 658.to be bishop of his own, that is, the English, nation;for Queen Baldhilda sent soldiers with orders to put thebishop to death ; whom Wilfrid, his clerk, attended tothe place where he was to be beheaded, being verydesirous, though the bishop opposed it, to die with him;but the executioners, understanding that he was astranger, and of the English nation, spared him, andwould not put him to death with his bishop.Returning to England, he was admitted to the friendship of King Alfrid, who had always followed thecatholic rules of the Church; and therefore ﬁnding himto be a Catholic, he gave him land of ten families, at theplace called Stanford; and not long after, the monastery,of thirty families, at the place called Ripon; whichplace he had lately given to those that followed the doctrine 0f the Scots, to build a. monastery upon. But,forasmuch as they afterwards, being left to their choice,would rather quit the place than adopt the catholicEaster, and other canonical rites, according to the custom of the Roman Apostolic Church, he gave the sameto him, whom he found to follow better discipline andbetter customs.At the same time, by the said king’s command, hewas ordained priest in the same monastery, by Agilbert, bishop of the West Saxons above-mentioned, theking being desirous that a man of so much piety andlearning should continue with him as priest and teacher;and not long after, having discovered and banished theScottish sect, as was said above, he, with the advice and 'R 2</p>

          <p>same among the acts of that synod, which was done in A.D.68l.this manner: “ Wilfrid, the beloved of God, bishop ofthe city of York, having referred to the Apostolic See,and being by that authority acquitted of every thing,whether speciﬁed against him or not, and having takenhis seat in judgment, with one hundred and twenty-ﬁveother bishops in the synod, made confession of the trueand catholic faith, and subscribed the same in the nameof all the northern part of Britain and Ireland, inhabitedby the English and Britons, as also by the Scots andPicts.”After this, returning into Britain, he converted theprovince of the South Saxons from their idolatrous worship. He also sent ministers to the Isle of Wight ; andin the second year of Alfrid, who reigned after ngrid,was restored to his see and bishopric by that king’s invitation. However, ﬁve years after, being again accusedby that same king and several bishops, he was again ex- «pelled his diocese. Coming to Rome, together with hisaccusers, and being allowed to make his defence before anumber of bishops and the apostolic Pope J ohn, it wasdeclared by the unanimous judgment of them all, that hisaccusem had in part laid false accusations to his charge;and the aforesaid pope undertook to write to the kingsof the English, Ethelred and Alfrid, to cause him to berestored to his bishopric, because he had been‘falselyaccused.His acquittal was much forwarded by the reading ofthe synod of Pope Agatho, of blessed memory, which hadbeen formerly held when Wilfrid was in Rome, and satin council among the bishops, as has been said before.For that synod being, on account of the trial, by orderof the apostolic pope, read before the nobility and a greatnumber of the people for some days, they came to theplace where it was written, “ Wilfrid, the beloved ofGod, bishop of the city of York, having referred hiscause to the Apostolic See, and being by that power</p>

Quod ubi lectum est, stupor apprehenditaudientes; et, silente lectore, coeperunt alterutrum requirere, quis esset ille Wilfridus episcopus? Tunc Bonifacius consiliarius apostolici papæ et alii perplures, quieum temporibus Agathonis papæ ibi viderant, dicebantipsum esse episcopum, qui nuper Romam accusatus asuis atque ab apostolica sede judicandus advenerat, “quijamdudum," inquiun , "æque accusatus huc adveniens,mox audita ac dijudicata causa et controversia utriusquepartis, a beatæ memoriæ papa Agathone probatus estcontra fas a suo episcopatu repulsus; et tanto apud eumhabitus est honore ut ipsum in concilio, quod congregarat, episcoporum, quasi virum incorruptæ ﬁdei et animiprobi residere præciperet."

Then Boniface, the pope’s counsellor, and manyothers, who had seen him there in the days of PopeAgatho, said, he was the same bishop that lately came toRome, to be tried by the Apostolic See, being accused- by his people, and who, said they, having long since beenhere upon such like accusation, the cause and controversy between both parties being heard and discussed,was proved by Pope A gath’o, of blessed memory, to havebeen wrongfully expelled from his bishopric, and somuch honoured by him, that he commanded him to sitin the council of bishops which he had assembled, as aman of untainted faith and an upright mind. This beingheard, the pope and all the rest said, that a man of suchgreat authority, who had exercised the episcopal functionnear forty years, ought not to be condemned, but beingcleared of all the crimes laid to his charge, to returnhome with honour.Passing through France, on his way back to Britain,on a. sudden he fell sick, and the distemper increasing,was so ill, that he could not ride, but was carried in hisbed. Being thus come to the city of Meaux, in France,he lay four days and nights, as if he had been dead, andonly by his faint breathing showed that he had any lifein him ; having continued so four days, without meat ordrink, speaking or hearing, be, at length, on the ﬁfthday, in the morning, as it were awakening out of a deadsleep, sat up in the bed, and opening his eyes, saw numbers of brethren singing and weeping about him, andfetching t a sigh, asked where Acca, the priest, was?This man, being called, immediately came in, and seeinghim thus recovered and able to speak, knelt down, andreturned thanks. to God, with all the brethren there present.

          <p>bishop ordered the rest to go out for an hour, and spoke A.D. 704.to the priest, Acca, in this manner :—“A dreadful vision has now appeared to me, whichI wish you to hear and keep secret, till I know how Godwill please to dispose of me. There stood by me a certain person, remarkable for his white garments, tellingme he was Michael, the archangel, and said, ‘ I am sentto save you from death: for the Lord has granted youlife, through the prayers and tears of your disciples, andthe intercession of his blessed mother Mary, of perpetualvirginity; wherefore I tell you, that you shall now recover from this sickness ; but be ready, for I will returnto visit you at the end of four years. But when you comeinto your country, you shall recover most of the possessions that have been taken from you, and shall end yourdays in perfect peace.’ ” The bishop accordingly recovered, at which all persons rejoiced, and gave thanksto God, and setting forward on his journey, arrivedin Britain.Having read the letters which he brought from theapostolic pope, Bertwald, the archbishop, and Ethelred,who had been formerly king, but was then an abbot,readily took his part; for the said Ethelred, calling tohim Coinred, whom he had m‘ade king in his own stead,he requested of him to be friends with Wilfrid, in whichrequest he prevailed; but Alfrid, king of the Northumbrians, refused to admit him, but died soon after. Hisson, Osred, then coming to the crown, and a synod beingassembled, near the river Nidd, after some contesting onboth sides, at length, by the consent of all, he wasadmitted to preside over his church; and thus he livedin peace four years, till the day of his death. He diedon the 12th of October, in his monastery, which hehad in the province of Undalum, under the governmentof the Abbot Cuthbald ; and by the ministry of the bre—thren, he was carried to his ﬁrst monastery of Ripon,and buried in the church of Saint Peter the Apostle, äïgä? at</p>

          <p>dore, one testimony among others is, that Albinus, his A.D.709.disciple, who succeeded him in the government of hismonastery, was so well instructed in the study of theScriptures, that he knew the Greek tongue to no smallperfection, and the Latin as thoroughly as the English,which was his native language.Acca, his priest, succeeded Wilfrid in the bishopric of 3:33:13?the church of Hagulstad; being himself a most activeman, and great in the sight of God and man, he muchadorned and added to the structure of his church, whichis dedicated to the Apostle St. Andrew. For he made ithis business, and does so still, to procure relics of theblessed apostles and martyrs of Christ from all parts, toplace them on altars, dividing the same by arches in thewalls of the church. Besides which, he diligently gathered the histories of their sufferings, together withother ecclesiastical writings, and erected there a mostnumerous and noble library. He likewise industriouslyprovided holy vessels, lights, and such like things asappertain to the adorning of the house of God. He inlike manner invited to him a celebrated singer, calledMaban, who had been taught to sing by the successorsof the disciples of the blessed Gregory in Kent, for himto instruct himself and his clergy, and kept him twelveyears, to teach such ecclesiastical songs as were notknown, and to restore those to their former state whichwere corrupted either by want of use, or through neglect.For Bishop Acca himself was a most expert singer, asWell as most learned in Holy Writ, most pure in the confession of the catholic faith, and most observant in therules of ecclesiastical institution; nor did he ever ceaseto be so till he received the rewards of his pious devotion,having been bred up and instructed among the clergyof the most holy and beloved of God, Bosa, bishop ofYork. Afterwards, coming to Bishop Wilfrid in hopesof improving himself, he spent the rest of his life underhim till that bishop’s death, and going with him to</p>

We mostreadily and willingly endeavour, according to your desire,to explain to you the catholic observance of holy Easter,according to what we have learned of the Apostolic See,as you, devout king, with a religious intention, have requested; 'for we know, that whenever the Church appliesitself to learn, to teach, and to assert the truth, whichare'the affairs of our Lord, the same is given to it fromheaven. For a certain worldly writer most truly said,that the world would be most happy if either kings werephilosophers, or philosophers were kings.

          <p>Gospel, that we are to wait for our Lord’s day in that A-D-710third week, and to keep the beginning 0f the Paschaltime on the same. Which threefold rule whosoever shallrightly observe, will never err in ﬁxing the Paschalfeast. But if you desire to be more plainly and fully .informed in all these particulars, it is written in Exodus,where the people of Israel, being about to be deliveredout of Egypt, are commanded to keep the ﬁrst Passover,that the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, ‘ This monthshall be unto you the beginning of months; it shall bethe ﬁrst month of the year to you. Speak ye unto allthe congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day ofthis month, they shall take to them every man a. lamb,according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for anhouse.” And a little lower, ‘ And he shall keep it untilthe fourteenth day of the same month; and the wholeassembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in theevening.’ By which words it most plainly appears, thatthus in the Paschal observance mention is made of thefourteenth day, not that the Passover is commanded tobe kept on that day : but the lamb is commanded to bekilled on the evening of the fourteenth day; that is, onthe ﬁfteenth day of the moon, which is the beginning ofthe third week, when the moon appears in the sky. Andbecause it was on the night of the ﬁfteenth moon, when,by the slaughter of the Egyptians, Israel was redeemedfrom a long captivity, therefore it is said, ‘ Seven daysshall ye eat unleavened bread.’ By which words all thethird week of the same month is decreed to be keptsolemn. But lest we should think that those same sevendays were to be reckoned from the fourteenth to thetwentieth, God immediately adds, ‘Even the ﬁrst day yeshall put away leaven out of your houses; for whosoevereateth leavened bread, from the ﬁrst day until theseventh day, that soul shall be cut of? from Israel ; ’ andso on, till he says, ‘For in this self-same day I will bringyour army out of the land of Egypt.’</p>

          <p>“ Thus he calls that the ﬁrst day of unleavened bread, A.D. 710.in which he was to bring their army out of Egypt. Butit is evident, that they were not brought out of Egypton the fourteenth day, in the evening whereof the lambwas killed, and which is properly called the Passover orPhase, but on the ﬁfteenth day, as is most plainly writtenin the book of Numbers. ‘ Departing therefore fromRamesse on‘ the ﬁfteenth day of the ﬁrst month, the nextday the Israelites kept the Passover with an high hand.’Thus the seven days of unleavened bread, on the ﬁrstwhereof the people of God were brought out of Egypt,are to be reckoned from the beginning of the third week,as has been said, that is, from the fourteenth day ofthe ﬁrst month, till the one-and-twentieth of the samemonth, that day included. But the fourteenth day isnoted down separately from this number, by the name ofthe Passover, as is plainly made out by what follows inExodus: where when it is said, ‘ For in this same dayI will bring your army out of the land of Egypt;’ it‘ispresently added, ‘ You shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. In the ﬁrst month, on the fourteenthday of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread,until the one—and—twentieth day of the month at even.Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses.’Now, who is there that does not perceive, that there arenot only seven days, but rather eight, from the fourteenth to the one—and—twentieth, if the fourteenth be alsoreckoned in the number? But if, as by diligent studyof Scripture appears to be the truth, we reckon from theevening of the fourteenth day to the evening of the oneand-twentieth, we shall certainly ﬁnd, that the samefourteenth day gives its evening for the beginning of thePaschal feast ; so that the sacred solemnity contains nomore than only seven nights and as many days. Bywhich our deﬁnition is proved to be true, wherein wesaid, that the Paschal time is to be celebrated in theﬁrst month of the year, and the third week of the same.</p>

          <p>For it is really the third week, because it begins on the A.D.710.evening of the fourteenth day, and ends on the eveningof the one-and-twentieth.“ But since Christ our Paschal Lamb is slain, and hasmade the Lord’s day, which among the ancients wascalled the ﬁrst after the Sabbath, a solemn day to us forthe joy of his resurrection, the apostolic tradition has soinserted it into the Paschal festivals as to decree, thatnothing in the least be anticipated, or detracted fromthe time of the legal Passover; but rather ordains, thatthe same ﬁrst month should be waited for, pursuant tothe precept of the Law, and accordingly the fourteenthday of the same, and the evening thereof. And whenthis day should happen to fall on the Sabbath, every onein his family should take a. lamb, and kill it in the even—ing, that is, that all the churches throughout the world,composing one catholic church, should provide bread andwine for the mystery of the ﬂesh and blood of the unspotted Lamb ‘ that took away the sins of the world;'and after the solemnity of reading the lessons andprayers of the Paschal ceremonies, they should offer upthese things to the Lord, in hopes of future redemption.For that same night in which the people of Israel weredelivered out of Egypt by the blood of the Lamb, is thevery same in which all the people of God were, by Christ’sresurrection, delivered from eternal death. Then, on themorning of the Lord’s day, they should celebrate theﬁrst day of the Paschal festival; for that is the day onwhich our Lord, with much joy of pious revelation, madeknown the glory of his resurrection. The same is theﬁrst day of unleavened bread, concerning which it isdistinctly written in Leviticus, ‘ In the fourteenth dayof the ﬁrst month, at even, is the Lord’s Passover. Andon the ﬁfteenth day of the same month, is the feast ofunleavened bread unto the Lord; seven days ye musteat unle‘avened bread; the ﬁrst day shall be most solemnand holy.’</p>

          <p>“ If therefore it could be that the Lord’s day should A.D. 7m.always happen on the ﬁfteenth day of the ﬁrst month,that is, on the ﬁfteenth moon, we might always celebrateEaster at the very same time with the ancient people ofGod, though the nature of the mystery be diﬁ'erent, aswe do it with one and the same faith. But in regardthat the day of the week does not keep pace exactly withthe moon, the apostolical tradition, which was preachedat Rome by St. Peter, and conﬁrmed at Alexandria byMark the Evangelist, his interpreter, appointed thatwhen the ﬁrst month was come, and in it the evening ofthe fourteenth day, we should also wait for the Lord’sday, which falls between the ﬁfteenth and the one—andtwentieth day of the same month. For on whichever ofthose days it shall fall, Easter will be properly kept onthe same; as it is one of those seven days on which theunleavened bread is ordered to be kept. Thus it comesto pass that our Easter never deviates from the thirdweek of the ﬁrst month, but either observes the whole,or at least some of the seven legal days of unleavenedbread. For though it takes in but one of them, that is,the seventh, which the Scripture so highly commends,saying, ‘ But the seventh day shall be more solemn andholy, ye shall do no servile work therein,’ none can layit to our charge, that we do not rightly keep our Lord'sPaschal day, which we received from the Gospel, in thethird week of the ﬁrst month, as the Law prescribes.“ The catholic reason of this observance being thusexplained; the unreasonable error, on the other hand,of those who, without any necessity, presume either toanticipate, or to go beyond the term prescribed in theLaw, is manifest. For they‘that think the Lord’s day ofEaster is to be observed from the fourteenth day of theﬁrst month till the twentieth moon, anticipate the timeprescribed in the law, without any necessary reason; forwhen they begin to celebrate the vigil of the holy nightfrom the evening of the thirteenth day, it is plain that</p>

          <p>they make that day the beginning of their Easter, A.D. 710.whereof they ﬁnd no mention in the Law; and when theyrefuse to celebrate our Lord’s Easter on the one-and—twentieth day of the month, they wholly exclude thatday from their solemnity, which the Law often recommends as memorable for the greater festival; and thus,perverting the proper order, they place Easter day in thesecond week, and sometimes keep it entirely in the same,and never bring it to the seventh day of the third week.And again, because they rather think that Easter is tobe kept on the sixteenth day of the said month, andso to the two-and—twentieth, they no less erroneously,though the contrary way, deviate from the right way oftruth, and as it were avoiding to be shipwrecked onScylla, they run on and are drowned in the whirlpool ofCharybdis. For when they teach that Easter is to bebegun at the rising of the sixteenth moon of the ﬁrstmonth, that is, from the evening of the ﬁfteenth day, itis manifest that they altogether exclude from their solemnity the fourteenth day of the same month, which theLaw ﬁrstly and chieﬂy recommends; so that they scarcelytouch upon the evening of the ﬁfteenth day, on whichthe people of God were delivered from the Egyptianservitude, and on which our Lord, by his blood, rescuedthe world from the darkness of sin, and on which beingalso buried, he gave us hopes of a blesseé repose afterdeath.“ And the same persons, taking upon themselves thepenalty of their error, when they place the Lord’s day ofEaster on the twenty-second day of the month, openlytrangress and exceed the legal term of Easter, as beginning the Easter on the evening of that day in whichthe Law appointed it to be ﬁnished and completed; andappoint that to be the ﬁrst day of Easter, whereof nomention is any where found in the Law, viz. the ﬁrst ofthe fourth week. And they are sometimes mistaken,not only in deﬁning and computing the moon’s age, but</p>

But the equinox,according to the Opinion of all the Eastern nations, andparticularly of the Egyptians, who exceed all otherlearned men in that calculation, usually happens on thetwelfth day of the kalends of April, as we also prove byhorological inspection. Whatever moon therefore is atthe full before the equinox, being on the fourteenth orﬁfteenth day, the same belongs to the last month of theforegoing year, and consequently is not proper for thecelebration of Easter; but that moon which is full afterthe equinox, or on the very equinox, belongs to the ﬁrstmonth, and in it, without a doubt, the ancients werewont to celebrate the Passover; and we also ought tokeep Easter when the Sunday comes. And that thismust be so, there is this cogent reason, because it iswritten in Genesis, that ‘ God made two lights; a greaterlight to rule the day, and a lesser light to rule the night.”Or, as another edition has it, ‘A greater light to beginthe day, and a lesser to begin the night.’ The sun,therefore, proceeding from the midst of the east, ﬁxedthe vernal equinox by his rising, and afterwards themoon, when the sun set in the evening, followed full fromthe midst of the east; thus every year the-same ﬁrstmonth of the moon must be observed in the like order,so that the full moon must be either on the very day ofthe equinox, as was done from the beginning, or after itis gone by. But if the full of the moon shall happen tobe but one day before the time of the equinox, the aforesaid reason proves that such moon is not to be assignedto the ﬁrst month of the new year, but rather to the lastof the preceding, and that it is therefore not proper forthe celebration of the Paschal festival.</p>

For we also, in this manneronly, can truly celebrate his solemnity, if we take carewith him to keep the Passover, that is, the passage outof this world to the Father, by faith, hope and charity.We are commanded to observe the full moon of thePaschal month after the vernal equinox, to the end, thatthe sun may ﬁrst make the day longer than the night,and then the moon may aﬁ'ord the world her full orb oflight; inasmuch as ﬁrst ‘ the sun of righteousness, inwhose wings is salvation,’ that is, our Lord J esus, by thetriumph of his resurrection, dispelled all the darkness ofdeath, and so ascending into heaven, ﬁlled his Church,which is often signiﬁed by the name of the moon, withthe light of inward grace, by sending down upon her hisSpirit. Which plan of salvation the prophet had in hismind, when he said ‘ The sun was exalted and the moonstood in her order.’“ He, therefore, who shall contend that the fullPaschal moon can happen before the equinox, deviatesfrom the doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, in the celebration of the greatest mysteries, and agrees with thosewho conﬁde that they may be saved without the graceof Christ forerunning them; and who presume to teachthat they might have attained to perfect righteousness,T</p>

Thus, afterthe equinoctial rising of the sun, and after the subsequent full moon of the ﬁrst month, that is, after the endof the fourteenth day of the same month, all which,according to the law, ought to be observed, we still, bythe instruction of the Gospel, wait in the third week forthe Lord’s day; and thus, at length, we celebrate ourdue Easter solemnity, to show that we do not, with theancients, honour the shaking off of the Egyptian yoke;but that, with devout faith and affection, we worship theredemption of the whole world; which having been preﬁgured in the deliverance of God’s ancient people, wascompleted in Christ’s resurrection, to make it appearthat we rejoice in the sure and certain hope of the dayof our own resurrection, which we believe will happen'on the same Lord's day. .“ Now this calculation of Easter, which we show youis to be followed, is contained in a circle or revolutionof nineteen years, which began long since, that is, inthe very times of the apostles, especially at Rome andin Egypt, as has been said above. But by the industryof Eusebius, who took his sumame from the blessedmartyr Pamphilus, it was reduced to a plainer system;insomuch that what till then used to be sent about toall the several churches by the patriarch of _ Alexandria,might, from that time forward, be most easily knownby all men, the course of the fourteenth day of themoon being regularly ordered. This Paschal calculation, Theophilus, patriarch of Alexandria, composed forthe Emperor Theodosius, for a hundred years to come.Cyril also, his successor, comprised a series of ninetyﬁve years in ﬁve revolutions of nineteen years.

          <p>churches throughout Britain, there are many who, A.D.7lo.having leamed the ancient rules of the Egyptians, canwith great ease carry on those revolutions of the Paschaltimes for any distant number of years, even to ﬁvehundred and thirty-two years, if they will; after theexpiration of which, all that belongs to the question ofthe sun and moon, of month and week, returns in thesame order as before. We therefore forbear to sendyou those revolutions of the times to come, because youonly desired to be instructed respecting the Paschaltime, and declared you had enough of those catholictables concerning Easter.“ But having said thus much brieﬂy and succinctly, asyou required concerning Easter, I also exhort you totake care to promote the tonsure, as ecclesiastical andagreeable to the Christian faith, for concerning thatalso you desired me to write to you; and we knowindeed that the apostles were not all shom after thesame manner, nor does the Catholic Church, though itagrees in the same Divine faith, hope and charity, agreein the same form of tonsure throughout the world: inﬁne, to look back to remote times, that is, the times ofthe patriarchs, J ob, the example of patience, when, onthe approach of tribulation, he shaved his head, made itappear that he had used, in time of prosperity, to lethis hair grow; and Joseph, the great practiser andteacher of chastity, humility, piety, and other virtues,is found to have been shorn when he was to be deliveredfrom servitude; by which it appears, that during thetime of servitude, he was in the prison Without cuttinghis hair. Now you may observe how each of thesemen of God differed in the manner of their appearanceabroad, though their inward consciences were alikeinﬂuenced by the grace of virtue. But though we maybe free to confess, that the diﬁ'erence of tonsure is nothurtful to those whose faith is pure towards God, andtheir charity sincere towards their neighbour, especially</p>
          <p>quam patribus catholicis, sicut de Paschæ vel fideidiversitate, conflictus, ita. etiam de tonsuræ diﬁ'erentia.legatur aliqua fuisse controversia; inter omnes tamen,quae vel in ecclesia, vel in universo hominum genere,reperimus tensuras, nullam magis sequendam nobis amplectendamque jure dixerim ea, quam in capite suo gestabat ille, cui se confitenti Dominus ait, [Matth. xvi.18,] Tu es Petrus, et super ham: petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam, et portæ inferni non praevalebunt adversuseam ; et tibi dabo claves regni cælorum. Nullam veromagis abominandam detestandamque merito cunctisfidelibus crediderim ea., quam habebat ille, cui gratiamsancti Spiritus comparare volenti dicit idem Petrus,Pecunia tua tecum sit in perditionem, quoniam donumDei existimasti per pecuniam possideri ; non enim esttibi pars neque sors in sermone hoc. Neque vero ob idtantum in coronam attondemur, quia Petrus ita attonsusest; sed quia Petrus in memoriam Dominicæ passionisita attonsus est, idcirco et nos, qui per eandem passionemsalvari desideramus, ipsius passionis signum cum illo invertice, summa videlicet corporis nostri parte, gesta,mus. Sicut enim omnis ecclesia, quia per mortem suiviviﬁcatoris ecclesia facta est, signum sanctæ crucis ejusin fronte portare consuevit, ut crebro vexilli hujus munimine a malignorum spirituum defendatur incursibus,crebra. hujus admonitione doceatur se quoque carnemsuam 'cum vitiis et concupiscentiis cruciﬁgere debere;ita etiam oportet eos, qui vel monachi votlim, vel gradumclericatus, habentes, arctioribus se necesse habent proDomino continentiæ frenis astringere.“ Formam quoque coronæ, quam ipse in passionespineam portavit in capite, ut spinas ac tribulos pecca</p>
          <p>since we do not read that there ever was any controversy A.D.710.among the Catholic fathers about the diﬁ'erence of tonsura, as there has been about the difference in keepingEaster, or in matters of faith; however, among all thetonsures that are to be found in the Church, or amongmankind at large, I think none more worthy of beingfollowed than that which that disciple had on his head,to whom, on his confession, our Lord said, ‘Thou artPeter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, andthe gates of hell shall not prevail against it, and to theeI will give the keys of the kingdom of heaven.’ Nordo I think any more worthy to be abhorred and detested, by all the faithful, than that which that manused, to whom Peter, when he would have bought thegrace of the Holy Ghost, said, ‘ Thy money be with theeto perdition, because thou thoughtest the gift of God to bepurchased for money; there is no part or lot for thee inthis speech.’ N or do we shave ourselves in the form ofa crown only because Peter was so shorn; but becausePeter was so shorn in memory of the passion of ourLord; therefore we also, who desire to be saved by thesame passion, do with him bear the sign of the samepassion on the top of our head, which is the highestpart of our body. For as all the Church, because itwas made a church by the death of him that gave it life,is wont to bear the sign of his holy cross on the forehead, to the end, that it may, by the constant protectionof his sign, be defended from the assaults of evil spirits,and by the frequent admonition of the same be instructed, in like manner, to crucify its ﬂesh with" itsvices and concupiscences; so also it behoves those, whohave either taken the vows of monks, or have any degreeamong the clergy, to curb themselves the more strictlyby continence.“ Every one of them is likewise to bear on his head,by means of the tonsure, the form of the crown whichChrist in his passion bore of thorns, in order that Christ</p>
          <p>torum nostrorum portaret, id est, exportaret et auferreta nobis, suo quemque in capite per tonsuram præferre,ut se etiam irrisiones et opprobria pro illo libenter acprompto animo suﬂ'erre ipso etiam frontispicio doceant;ut coronam vitæ æternæ, quam repromisit Deus diligentibus se, se semper exspectare, proque hujus perceptione et adversa se mundi et prospera contemnere,designent. Ceterum, tonsuram eam, quam magumferunt habuisse Simonem, quis, rogo, fidelium non statimcum ipsa magia detestetur, et merito exsqu'let? Quæprimo aspectu in frontis quidem superficie coronæ videturspeciem præferre; sed ubi ad cervicem considerandoperveneris decurtatam eam, quam te videre putabas,invenies coronam, ut merito talem Simoniacis et nonChristianis habitum convenire cognoscas; qui in præsenti quidem vita. a deceptis hominibus putabantur digniperpetuæ gloria coronæ, sed in ea, quae hanc sequitur,vitam, non solum omni spe coronæ privati, sed æterna.insdper sunt pcena. damnati.“ Neque vero me haec ita. prosecutum æstimes, quasieos, qui hanc tonsuram habent, condemnandos judicem,si ﬁde et operibus unitati catholicae faverint; imo conﬁdenter proﬁteor plurimos ex eis sanctos ac Deo dignosexstitisse, ex quibus est Adamnanus abbas et sacerdosColumbiensium egregius, qui cum legatus suæ gentis adAlfridum regem missus nostrum quoque monasteriumvidere voluisset, miramque in moribus ac verbis prudentiam, humilitatem, religionem, ostenderet, dixi illiinter alia colloquens; ‘ Obsecro, sancte frater, qui adcoronam te vitæ, quæ terminum nesciat, tendere credis,quid contrario tuæ ﬁdei habitu terminatam in capitecoronæ imaginem portas? et si beati consortium Petriquæris, cur ejus, quem ille anathematizavit, tonsurae</p>
          <p>may bear the thorns and briars of our sins; that is, A.D.7l0.that he may remove and take them from us; and alsothat they may at once show that they, willingly, andwith a ready mind, endure scoffs and reproaches for hissake; to make it appear, that they always expect ‘thecrown of eternal life, which God has promised to thosethat love him,” and that for the gaining thereof theydespise both the adversities and the prosperities of thisworld. But'as for the tonsure which Simon'Magus issaid to have used, what Christian will not immediatelydetest and cast it oﬂ' together with his magic? Uponthe top of the forehead, it does seem indeed to resemblea crown; but when you come to the neck, you willﬁnd the crown you thought you had seen so perfect cutshort; so that you may be satisﬁed such a distinctionproperly belongs not to Christians but to Simoniacs,such as were indeed in this life thought worthy of a.perpetual crown of glory by erring men; but in thatlife which is to follow this, are not only deprived of allhopes of a. crown, but are moreover condemned toeternal punishment.“But do not think that I have said thus much, asjudging those who use this tonsure, are to be damned, incase they favour the catholic unity in faith and actions;on the contrary, I conﬁdently declare, that many of themhave been holy and worthy of God. Of which numberis Adamnan, the abbot and renowned priest of Columba,who, when sent ambassador by his nation to KingAlfrid, came to see our monastery, and discoveringwonderful wisdom, humility, and religion in his wordsand behaviour, among other things, I said to him indiscourse, ‘ I beseech you, holy brother, who think youare advancing to the crown of life, which lmows noperiod, why do you, contrary to the habit of your faith,wear on your head a crown that is terminated, orbounded? And if you aim at the society of St. Peter,why do you imitate the tonsure of him whom St. Peter</p>
          <p>imaginem imitaris? et non potius ejus, cum quo inæternum beatus vivere cupis, etiam nunc habitum te,quantum potes, diligere monstras ?' Respondit ille;‘ Scias pro certo, frater mi dilecte, quia etsi Simonistonsuram ex consuetudine patria. habeam, Simoniacamtamen perfidiam tota. mente detestor ac respuo; beatissimi autem apostolorum principis, quantum mea parvitassuﬂicit, vestigia, sequi desidero.' At ego; ‘ Credo,’ inquam, ‘ vere quod ita. sit; sed tamen indicio ﬁt quod ea,quæ apostoli Petri sunt, in abdito cordis amplectimini,si quae ejus esse nostis, etiam in facie tenetis. Namqueprudentiam tuam facillime dijudicare reor, quod aptiusmulto sit- ejus, quem corde toto abominatis,- cujusquehorrendam faciem videre refugis, habitum vultus a. tuovultu Deo jam dicato separare; et e contra., ejus, quemapud Deum habere patronum quæris, sicut facta velmonita cupis sequi, sic etiam morem habitus te imitaricondeceat.’. "Hæc tunc Adamnano dixi, qui quidem quantum;conspectis ecclesiarum nostrarum statutis, profecisset,probavit, cum reversus ad Scotiam multas postea gentisejusdem turbas ad catholicam temporis Paschalis observantiam sua prædicatione correxit; tametsi eos, quiin Hii insula morabantur, monachos, quibusque specialirectoris jure praeerat, necdum ad viam statuti meliorisreducere valebat. Tonsuram quoque, si tantum sibiauctoritatis subesset, emendare meminisset.“ Sed et tuam nunc prudentiam, rex, admoneo, ut ea,quæ unitati catholicæ et apostolicæ ecclesiæ concinunt,una. cum gente, cui te Rex regum et Dominus dominorum præfecit, in omnibus servare contendas. Sicenim ﬁt, ut post acceptam temporalis regni potentiam,ipse beatissimus apostolorum princeps cælestis quoque</p>
          <p>anathematized? and why do you not rather even now A.D.710.show that you imitate to your utmost the habit of himwith whom you desire to live happy for ever.’ Heanswered, ‘ Be assured, my dear brother, that though Ihave Simon’s tonsure, according to the custom of mycountry, yet I utterly detest and abhor the Simoniacalwickedness; and I desire, as far as my littleness iscapable of doing it, to follow the footsteps of the mostblessed prince of the apostles.’ I replied, ‘ I verilybelieve it as you say; but let it appear by showing outwardly such things as you know to be his, that you inyour hearts embrace whatever is from Peter the Apostle.For I believe your wisdom does easily judge, that it ismuch more proper to estrange your countenance, alreadydedicated to God, from resemblance to him whom inyour heart you abhor, and of whose hideous face youwould shun the sight; and, on the other hand, that itbecomes you to imitate the outward resemblance of him,whom you seek to have for your advocate with God, asyou desire to follow his actions and instructions.’“This I then said toAdamnan, who indeed showedhow much he had improved upon seeing the statutes ofour churches, when, returning into Scotland, he afterwards by his preaching brought great numbers of thatnation over to the catholic observance of the Paschaltime; though he was not yet able to gain the consentof the monks that lived in the island of Hii, over whomhe presided. He would also have been mindful to amendthe tonsure, if his authority had extended so far.“ But I also admonish your wisdom, O king, that youendeavour to make the nation, over which the King ofkings, and Lord of lords, has placed you, observe in allpoints those things which appertain to the unity of theCatholic and Apostolic Church; for thus it will come topass, that after your temporal kingdom has passed away,the blessed prince of the apostles will lay open to youand yours the entrance into the heavenly kingdom,</p>

Statimnamque jussu publico mittebantur ad transcribendum,discendum, observandum, per universas Pictorum provincias circuli Paschae decennovenales, obliteratis peromnia erroneis octoginta et quatuor annorum circulis.Attondebantur ofnnes in coronam ministri altaris acmonachi; et quasi novo se discipulatui beatissimi apostolorum principis Petri subditam, ejusque tutandampatrocinio, gens correcta gaudebat.</p>
          <p>where you will rest for ever with the elect. The grace A.D. 710.of the eternal King preserve thee in safety, longreigning, for the peace of us all, my most beloved sonin Christ.”This letter having been read in the presence of KingNaitan, and many more of the most learned men, andcarefully interpreted into his own language by those whocould understand it, he is said m_have much rejoiced atthe exhortation; insomuch that, rising from among hisgreat men that sat abeut him, he knelt on the ground,giving thanks to God that he had been found worthy toreceive such &amp; present from the land of the English,and, said he, “ I knew indeed before, that this was thetrue celebration of Easter, but now I so fully know thereason for observing of this time, that I seem convincedthat I knew little of it before. Therefore I publiclydeclare and protest to you that are here present, that Iwill for ever continually observe this time of Easter,with all my nation; and I do decree that this tonsure,which we have heard is most reasonable, shall be receivedby all the clergy in my kingdom.” Accordingly heimmediately performed by his regal authority what hehad said. For the circles or revolutions of nineteenyears were presently, by public command, sent throughout all the provinces of the Picts to be transcribed,learned and observed, the erroneous revolutions of eighty—four years being every where suppressed. All theministers of the altar and monks had the crown shorn,and the nation thus reformed, rejoiced, as being newlyput under the direction of Peter; the most blessed princeof the apostles, and secure under his protection.</p>

For inthe year after the incarnation of our Lord 716, whenOsfred was slain, and Coenred took upon him the government of the kingdom of the Northumbrians, the holyfather and priest, Egbert, beloved of God, and worthy tobe named with all honour, whom" we have often mentioned before, coming among them; was joyfully andhonourably received. Being a most agreeable teacher,and devout in practising those things which he taught,and being willingly heard by all, he, by his pious and frequent exhortations, converted them from that inveteratetradition of their ancestors, of whom may be said thosewords of the apostle, “ That they had the zeal of God,but not according to knowledge.” He taught them toperform the principal solemnity after the catholic and .apostolic manner, as has been said, under the ﬁgure of a.perpetual circle; which appears to have been accomplished by a wonderful dispensation of the Divine good—ness; to the end, that the same nation which had willingly, and without envy, communicated to the Englishpeople the lmowledge of the true Deity, should afterwards, by means of the English nation, be broughtWhere they were defective to the true rule of life. Evenas, on the contrary, the Britons, who would not acquaintthe English with the knowledge of the Christian faith,now, when the English people enjoy the true faith, andare thoroughly instructed in its rules, continue inveterate in their errors, expose their heads without a</p>

This man of God, Egbert, remainedthirteen years in the aforesaid island, which he had thusconsecrated again to Christ, by kindling in it a new rayof Divine grace, and restoring it to the unity of ecclesiastical discipline. In the year of our Lord’s incarnation 729, in which the Easter of our Lord was celebratedon the 24th of April, he performed the solemnity of themass, in memory of the same resurrection of our Lord,and dying that same day, thus ﬁnished, or rather neverceases to celebrate, with our Lord, the apostles, and theother citizens of heaven, that greatest festival, which hehad begun with the brethren, whom he had converted tothe unity of grace. But it was a wonderful dispensationof the Divine Providence, that the venerable man notonly passed out of this world to the Father, in Easter,but also when Easter was celebrated on that day, onwhich it had never been wont to be kept in those parts.The brethren rejoiced in the certain and catholic knowledge of the time of Easter, and rejoiced in the protection of their father, departed to our Lord, by whom theyhad been converted. He also congratulated his being solong continued in the ﬂesh till he saw his followersadmit, and celebrate with him, that as Easter day whichthey had ever before avoided.

He was buried in the porch of St.Paul the Apostle, which he had built within the churchof St. Andrew for his own place of burial. After himAldwulf took upon him the ofﬁce of bishop, having beenconsecrated by Archbishop Bertwald.In ‘the year of our Lord’s incarnation 729, two comets A.D. 729.appeared about the sun, to the great terror of the beholders. One of them went before the rising sun in themorning, the other followed him when he set at night, asit were presaging much destruction to the east and west ;one was the forerunner of the day, and the other of thenight, to signify that mortals were threatened with calamities at both times.

At which time a dreadful plague of Saracensravaged France with miserable slaughter; but they notlong after in that country received the punishment dueto their wickedness. In which year the holy man ofGod, Egbert, departed to our Lord, as has been saidabove, on Easter day; and immediately after Easter,that is, on the 9th of May, Osric, king of the Northumbrians, departed this life, after he had reigned eleVenyears, and appointed Ceolwulf, brother to Coenred,who had reigned before him, his successor; the beginning and progress of whose reign were so ﬁlledwith commotions, that it cannot yet be known whatis to be said concerning them, or What end they willhave. .In the year of our Lord’s incarnation 731, Archbishop A.D. 731.Bertwald died of old age, on the 9th of J anuary, havingheld his see thirty-seven years, six months and fourteendays. In his stead, the same year, Tatwine, of theprovince of the Mercians, was made archbishop, havingbeen a priest in the monastery called Briudun. He wasconsecrated in the city of Canterbury by the venerableme'n, Daniel, bishop of Winchester, Ingwald of London,Aldwin of Litchﬁeld, and Aldwulf of Rochester, onSunday, the 10th of June, being a man renowned forreligion and wisdom, and notably learned in SacredWrit.Thus at present, the bishops Tatwine and Aldwulfpreside in the churches of Kent; Ingwald in the province of the East Saxons.

          <p>Wiccians, Wilfrid; in the province of the Lindisfarnes, A-D- 7315Cynebert presides; the bishopric of the isle of Wightbelongs to Daniel, bishop of Winchester. The provinceof the South Saxons, having now continued some yearswithout a bishOp, receives the episcopal ministry fromthe prelate of the West Saxons. All these provinces,and the others southward t0 the bank of the riverHumber, with their kings, are subject to King Ethelbald.But in the province of the Northumbriane, whereKing Ceolwuli' reigns, four bishops now preside; Wil—frid in the church of York, Ethelwald in that of Lindisfame, Acca in that of Hagulstad, Pechthelm in thatwhich is called the White House, which, from the increased number of believers, has lately become an episcopal see, and has him for its ﬁrst prelate. The Pictsalso at this time are at peace with the English nation,and rejoice in being united in peace and truth with thewhole Catholic Church. The Scots that inhabit Britain, satisﬁed with their own territories, meditate nohostilities against the nation of the English. The Britons, though they, for the most part, through innatehatred, are adverse to the English nation, and wrongfully, and from wicked custom, oppose the appointedEaster of the whole Catholic Church; yet from boththe Divine and human power withstanding them, canin no way prevail as they desire; for though in partthey are their own masters, yet elsewhere they are alsobrought under subjection to the English. Such beingthe peaceable and calm disposition of the times, many ofthe Northumbrians, as well of the nobility as privatepersons, laying aside their weapons, rather incline to dedicate both themselves and their children'to the tonsureand monastic vows, than to study martial discipline.What will be the end hereof, the next age will show.This is for the present the state of all Britain; in the"year since the coming of the English into Britain about</p>

In the nineteenth year of myage, I received deacon’s orders; in the thirtieth, thoseof the priesthood, both of them by the ministry of themost reverend Bishop J ohn, and by order of the AbbotCeolfrid.
